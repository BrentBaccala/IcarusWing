We don't want you here!  The people of Hawaii don't want you!

What people?

The majority!  The majority!

Well, now we're the majority!  If we can win the election!

Like hell you are!  You're trying to rig the election!  We won't let
you get away with it, we'll fight you, you son-of-a-bitch!

That's the majority - always in charge and ready to fight like hell to
keep it that way!

We won't accept any rigged election!

Do I have 2 percert support?  Do 1 out of 50 Americans support me?
Then why shouldn't we have 1 out of 50 states?  What's rigged about
it?  And so what if we just want to take it and leave - do we have
freedom or don't we?

And what about the people who don't want your socialist shit!

You can go to the mainland!  You can get the hell out!  The New Hawaii
- Love It or Leave It!

What you're talking about is no different from a revolution!  We won't
take it, I swear to God, we won't take it!

That's right!  That's what all the hype about democracy is!  Every 4
years we get to have another revolution!  And somebody else just
figured out how to do it!  And now you don't want the elections
anymore!  Now you don't like democracy!  Now your gonna fight back!

This isn't democracy!  You're taking over the government!

Well, what is democracy, then?  Is it a legal form of government,
where power can be achieved legitimately by anybody who can do it by
following the rules?  Or it a tyranny, just MAJORITY RULE?
