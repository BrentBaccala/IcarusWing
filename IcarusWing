T - 391 days

It was a brillent hack.  It was better than the one they did in
college, when the campus news server wouldn't accept posts from the
student lab.  They had recompiled the server with gcc, goten a smaller
executable than the original, altered it so that after printing 502
ACCESS DENIED it went and accepted the post anyway and padded it out
to make the CRC come out right.  They wern't using MD5 back then,
heck, it hadn't even been invented yet.  Then Burns dug through the
engineering and computer science library for the VAX Architecture
Reference Manual, figured how to drop the student workstations into a
diagnostic mode by hitting the little blue button on the back of the
machine, installed packet sniffers on couple of them, and waited a few
days to grab the server's root password as it went by over an
unencrypted telnet.  They went in as root and just dropped the new
server binary onto the hard drive.  It ran for six months unnoticed,
until the staff updated the whole OS installation.  But this hack was
even better.

They had been planing it for months.  Well, they'd been talking about
it for years really, but months to actually do it.  They targeted a
major router manufactuer.  Routers, for the uninformed, are the
telephone switches of computer networks, that handle almost all the
data packets and make decisions about how to get data packet X to
destination Y. First, Burns got a job with the company.  It wasn't
hard.  An economic boom was in progress, every bunch of
twenty-somethings with a neat program had a startup corporation
running, and skilled programmers were in short supply.  Various ideas
were proposed to hack them, ranging from tapping into the router line
and hopeing somebody will come in and type the password in the clear,
to Burns' pet scheme for an Ethernet wiretap built from a
thousand-plus element phased array to built in the woods across from
the company's office park.  Unfortunately they neither the money nor
the manpower to construct such a device.  Finally, Marcelius Mercurio
stepped in and showed why he was the Captain.  Somebody just had to go
in and get a job with them.  Burns' qualifications were impecable.

At first he just watched the place, as he went about his assigned
coding project - a boring extension to a ten-year-old routing
protocol.  Back at the rented apartment, Marc drilled him for days to
read passwords - Burns looking over Marc's shoulder as he typed and
telling him what he just entered.  They'd drill for an hour each day,
which Marc liked to say way the minimum amount of time to put into
doing something.  It was a big pain, Burns hated it, and turns out
they never used them, but by the end of the month they had every
important password in the place.

They spent the time getting a good look at the development system.
Burns went right for his favorite program - the gcc compiler.  It was
several years old, and he floated a question with
management about updating it, and practically yelped with glee when
he heard the answer.  They wasn't just turning down the idea;
they were dead set against upgrading the compiler.  Since their
routers used several different hardware platforms, custom compiler
configurations were required for each platform.  This meant a lot
of work to upgrade the compiler, which could only be justified
by a significant improvement.  Also, they expressed fear of hackers
putting something "funny" in a newer compiler.

"This means," Burns spurted through a exhaled mouthful of marijuana
smoke, "that we can change the compiler with near absolute certainty
that they won't just upgrade it away in a few months."  He didn't want
to repeat his college experience of an upgrade taking away a favorite
hack.  The stakes were a lot higher, too.

Having settled on the compiler, they set to work on the hack, Burns
doing most of the coding, Marc watching over his shoulder and doing
code reviews.  They had to get it right.  The virus was designed to
disappear into the compiler's binary, recreating itself if the
compiler was asked to re-compile itself, as well as infecting the
target program.  Since they weren't too sure about how they would
alter the router software, they added another feature - a third prong
of the virus, targeted against the operating system kernel, that would
give them a back door.  Marc didn't have a job, so he fixed dinner
every night and generally took care of the apartment.  It was just the
two of them living there, and on weekend nights they'd party with some
of the waitresses from a seafood joint Burns liked to hit for a quick
drink on the way home from work.  On weekends, and some weeknights,
they'd stay up 'till two or three in the morning, smoking dope,
snorting coke, cranking the tunes.  Just like college.

The problem remained of getting the hack into the compiler; probably
the hardest step.  They thought they knew the root passwords, but
Burns wasn't supposed to have them, and the question remained of when
could he successfully use them to hack the main development system.
Log entries are generated when root passwords are used, and while they
could be fudged, it was an extra level of complexity that Marc, a firm
beleiver in K.I.S.S, didn't want to deal with.  Marc resolved the
question - they wouldn't use the passwords at all, but rather waited
until the system was down for a routine maintenance.  Burns made sure
he was in the server room that day, working on a tricky install of a
new high-speed optical interface in one of the test machines.
Somehow, he just couldn't get the settings right, until everyone was
out of the room for a few minutes.  He slapped a cable onto a special
PCMCIA card that had been siting in the laptop for the last week,
plugged the other end into the server's hard drive, powered it, hit a
three-key sequence on the laptop, which beeped two seconds later.
Burns killed the power before the server's CPU had gotten out of BIOS,
replaced the original cable to the drive, and walked away with his
laptop.  Since they weren't using a cryptographic file system yet,
they didn't even have to worry about forging signatures.  He finished
the tricky install in less than five minutes and left, just as the
server workers came back with the new power supply.  He had been
practicing at home for a week.  The actual hack took less than 10
seconds.

Now they leaned back and waited.  Marc starting spending his days at
the library, researching various computer companies as well as
starting to make some discrete inquires about land in the midwest.
Burns tinkered with the virus a few more times, but they were already
in, so it was just a matter of copying a file up to the server and
running a bizarre little system call that should just have returned an
error but instead jumped into the file's code at full kernel
privledge.  Burns was really careful every time he used it, because a
slipup would crash the system and that might begin to attract
attention.  Marc insisted that each change was carefully tested before
Burns installed it.  They took a test suite for the compiler, added
several tests to check and verify the correct operation of the virus,
and ran it against every proposed update to make sure everything was
working flawlessly.  If they found a problem, or added a new feature,
they added a test case to make sure it didn't crop up again.  They
practiced better software design on the hack than anybody in the
company did on their software.  They had to - they couldn't afford a
bug.

Burns got sick of the job and quit.  He had never taken the job
because he liked it.  Told his boss he'd had a better offer elsewhere,
which wasn't unusual in the prevalent economic environment.  Declined
to discuss it.  Was offered a raise.  Politely refused.  He offered
two weeks more work.  Politely declined.  They handed him his last
paycheck and he walked out the door for the last time.

They'd come to regret that later, but Burns was never very good at
working on a boring job.  He'd either find other people to pass it off
to, or drop it entirely.  Mercurio didn't like this tendancy, but had
learned to deal with it over the years, and knew he had to keep Burns
supplied with a steady stream of new challenges, so he let it pass.

Three months later, the manufacuer released the first production
version of their router software unwittingly compiled with the hacked
compiler.  That meant that the software was hacked, as was any
customer who downloaded and used it.  Many did, both because software
had a deserved reputation for poor quality, necessitating frequent
updates, and because the company was constantly adding new features.
This release had an additional feature they didn't count on.  It
allowed a carefully formed packet to run arbitrary code on the router.
Burns kept improving the hack.  Since almost all the routers were
somehow connected to the net, he could get away with this even though
he no longer worked for the company.  Soon, he could wiretap the
routers, retreieve their passwords, add new passwords without them
appearing in any configuration files, generate connections that
seemed to appear out of thin air, and generally infiltrate any
network using the company's routers.

Their first major target was a manufactuer of Keno software.  They had
toyed with the idea of hacking a bank, but both men reasoned that bank
security would be very tight, neither had any inside experience
working at a bank, and a hack that made money appear out of nowhere
would be very suspicious to auditors.  Instead, they settled on the
Keno maker.  They went for a very subtle hack, that replaced the
random number generator with one of their own, and Burns couldn't
surpress a smile under his face a month later as he sat in a bar and
watched the numbers came up on the screen.  They matched the list he
had drawn up the night before.

Mercurio called a old friend his, a doctor named Victor Antonov, who
knew a real estate broker who knew a a ranch site in New Mexico;
pretty high up, flat, and twenty miles down a back road.  A good road,
though - dirt, but a good road that trucks could come down.  Marc
brought Vic in on the hack, since he knew he would need a doctor, and
his old friend topped the list, and now started to spend money - used
trailers for the construction site; a front corporation; phony
building permits for a large dairy.  Vic asked about the money; the
Captain just shrugged.

"If the hack works, we've got some cash," he said, "if not, we've got
problems no matter what."

"Do you think we should stake everything on this hack?"

"No," Marc answered after a short pause, "but I am."

The break can within six months.  The Kansas state jackpot in the
Pick-Five-Plus had risen to over $11 million.  Marc knew the numbers
would hit.  What kept him up all night was the thought of somebody
else picking the numbers at random.  Nobody did.

Vic had picked the winning ticket, and the doctor revealed in the
limelight.  For the first time in his life, he was in front of
T.V. cameras.  He told his story, his bills from medical school, his
work for the doctors, his work for the clinics, his general
disillusionment with medicine.  "Everyone grips about H.M.O.s and
professional assocations and the cost of medical insurance," he told
one press conference.  "If the doctors would just forget about the
money and heal the people who came to them, we wouldn't have all these
problems."  One reporter asked him if he was going to start a medical
philanthropy with the money.  A little grin washed over his mouth and
his mustashe bristled.  "Actually, I'm starting a dot-com".

They called it Robotics Research.  Which wasn't far from the truth.
Marc certainly planed to do a lot of work robotically.  He was also
careful to keep the company's cash burn under a half-million a month,
even considering things like his deal to purchase 60 PCs and 60
laptops for a hundred thousand, complete with wireless networking
cards.  Wireless cards for which they had a amplifier design.  They
just stamped out a small run of 150 circuit boards and soldered them
on.  The dozen young programmers they'd hired started to find some of
the quirks of their management when a hundred of the computers just
disappeared out the door to a remote location know only as "Site Y".
They were still available over the network, though, and they were
starting to run some pretty serious simulation software that would
keep them running all night.  Mostly Jasper's code, Navier-Stokes
equations, wing design, hypersonic flight, that kind of thing.
Robotics Research accumulated a sizable collection of robots, and most
of the software running them was pretty simple.  Just basic remote
control, really.  Boring stuff, and Marc had to struggle to hold on
to some of his brighter employees.  He gave them an orbital mechanics
system to work with and enhance.  No explaination given what a
robotics company would want with orbital mechanics.  Yet the work was
interesting, so most of the programmers stayed on.

Meanwhile, Marc had still been playing the lotteries.  The hack had
worked its way into both Maryland's and Flordia's systems, and Marc
himself decided to have his fifteen minutes of fame in Flordia, then
had Jasper's mom hit it big.  People who knew them well started to
wonder.  If you somebody you know hit the jackpot, it was a big deal,
but three people?  Questions were already starting to rise when New
Year's came around.  The core team got together at a ski resort in
Taos and went back to a rented ski house afterwards.  Vic, as usual,
was the one to question the lottery winnings, and the increasing money
drain.  Marc just stood in the corner and puffed on a joint.  "This
is the year of living dangerously."

Marc had leveraged the roughly $20 million from the lotterys into
about $100 million using fraduent financial statements to get various
loans for land and equipment.

In 1998, _)_ had become the first man in history to win a Nobel Prize
for writing a computer program.  It was called _Gaussian_, and it
numerically simulated Schroedinger's equation, the defining physical
equation for explaining the complex interactions between the electrons
and nuclei that formed atoms and molecules, and made it possible to
analyze atomic structures in much the same was as numerical
simulations of Newton's gravitational equations made possible the
analyze of planetary movement in solar systems.  For the first
time, physics was beginning to correctly predict the physical
properties of matter that until then had only been understood
empirically by chemists.

Burns dumped the money from the lottery into copies of _Gaussian_,
along with its most elaborately expensive spinoffs and a team of
programmers, including a bright 20-year-old South African chemist
named Alister Compton.  They set up shop south of San Francisco, in a
Silicon Valley office building in Palo Alto, near Stanford University.
A roaring economic boom kept restaurants, bars, and shopping malls
packed with young, dreamy-eyed twenty-somethings sitting on thousands
of dollars worth of stock options.  Every other car on University
Avenue was either a Ferrari, or a BMW, or a Land Rover - most of them
leased.  Up scale restaurants provided their patrons with blank paper
placemats and colorful Crayons to doodle and brainstorm their latest
propietary server architecture while waiting for their hundred dollar
orders.

Burns set his team to work on his assortment of computational
chemistry programs.  What they were looking for, he explained, was a
new type of liquid rocket fuel.  Many liquid fuels, such as liquid
hydrogen, were cryogenic and required elaborate cooling systems to
keep them refrigerated well below freezing.  NASA, for example, kept
the space shuttle's rocket fuel stored in a specially built
underground tank, and only pumped it into the shuttle's external tank
the night before launch.  Worse, even most efficient liquid fuels had
rather poor specific impulses, that crucial ratio between the force
generated by the propellant and the force exerted on it by gravity,
and also rather poor specific volumes, resulting in the need for very
large tanks to contain the propellants.  Solid fuel propellants
performed better, which is why the space shuttle used a pair of
booster rockets to help propel it into space, but with the severe
drawback that they couldn't be simply throttled back or turned off
like liquid fuel propellants.  Burns wanted to develop a liquid fuel
that would remain liquid at room temperature, eliminating the need for
elaborate cooling systems, and that would have a specific impulse and
specific volume rivaling the best of the solid propellants.

He set his programmers to work installing an array of fast, expensive
computers he had brought to perform the Shroedinger approximations in
parallel, running dozens of computers simultaneously to predict the
melting point, boiling point, ionization energy, chemical potential,
thermodynamic constants, a dozen other predictions that may or may not
be accurate.  Once a promising candidate was identified, the next
question was how to create it in a series of reactions.  Again, the
computers were asked to compute more and more predictions for the
possible byproducts and derivatives of the compound in question, then
reacted in simulation by more programs to find out if such-and-such a
combination producing such-and-such a result would actually proceed
forward in reasonable time at some specified temperature.  Since none
of the software was more than a few years old, really, and since it
crashed constantly, and produced bizarre predictions like its
continued, stuburn belief, much to Burns' great alarm and dismay, that
kerosene would react with hydrogen peroxide at a specific impulse of
298 without the presence of a catalyst.  So the only way to find out
if any of the predictions were even remotely possible, they had to
test them, and Burns set up both a well-stocked chemistry lab and
eventually a small rocket engine on a firing range.


T - 350 days plus a few months

Paydirt.  Finally, the computer had a prediction that worked.  It was
a complex, strangely ringed molecule dominated by nitrogen bonds,
liquid at room temperature, that could be synthacized from nitrogen
gas after a string of six reactions.  The kicker was that it reacted
with hydrogen peroxide, without a catalyst, to produce a specific
impulse close to 1000, which was higher by far than any conventional
rocket fuel.  Since it was the hundred and thirty third nitrogen
compound suggested by the computer as a possible fuel, it
retained its original designation and became known as N-133.

They sold it to NASA in a heartbeat, and were briefly the next glamour
company looking forward to a mega-IPO.  Mercurio patented the formula
and manufactuering process and as much of the design process as he
could, then released the patents to the public domain, stating that he
had adquired the patents to establish beyond doubt that they had
invented the technology, that anyone could now use it, and that nobody
else could patent it.  His action was praised by many as an exemplar
of corporate responsibility, and to a stunned financial community now
wondering how he would pay for his startup, he announced that he had
ample funding from private sources.

In any event, no IPO was needed for legatimancy.  Burns had leased a
chemical manufauering plant, rapidly refitted it to produce the fuel,
and quickly had the first and only commercial source for the dream
fuel.  Boing asked for samples.  NASA placed a huge order.

Frozen with fear, Dr. Andrea Yeats stared at the young man in his
early twenties sitting in the passenger seat near to her.  His jeans
were ripped, his hair unkempt, and his body excuded a faint odor that
betrayed the three days that had passed since his last shower.  His
heavy blond hair and muscular upper body betrayed months of surfing on
the Southern California beaches.  His eyes had narrowed to slits, and
his lewd smile told that the money in her purse wasn't the only thing
he'd be taking.

"I'm inquiring into one of your accounts - Robotics Research; they're
applying for a sizable line of credit and listed your bank on the
financial statements they provided us.  According to these statements
they have several million dollars on deposit with you, right?"

"That's right.  They're one of our larger customers.  They do a lot of
business, and they always cover their checks; we've never had a
problem with them."

"Mr. Mercurio, the CEO, said they had a line of credit?"

"That's right, they have a fifty million dollar line of credit secured
by an six-story office building they own in San Francisco.  They've
had the credit line for two or three years now; they used it once, and
repaid in a couple of months."

"So you'd say they're a good credit risk?"

"Absolutely.  They're one of our best customers."

"OK, thank you very much."

Burns hung up the phone and swiveled around in his chair to find
Alister staring at him from the entrance of the room.

"Is that legal?"


T - 57 days

Burns dug into his pocket, pulled out the buzzing cell phone, and
squinted at its display.

"Oh shit."

Mercurio stopped eating and looked at him quizically.  So did Alister.

"It's one of _those_ numbers."

"Which one?"

"I'm not sure - 555-5713."

"Shit, which one's that?  The list on my laptop; I've got to boot it."

"No, this thing's gonna cover to my voicemail."

"Oh, fuck."

Alister grabbed the phone out of Burns' hand and hit the talk button.

"Hello, our office hours are nine to five, Pacific Standard Time..."

"Get something that beeps," Burns whispered furtively, and Marc pulled
out his pager and held it across the table.

"...and we'll get back to you right away."  Marc hit a button on the
pager, it emitted a quick beep-beep-beep, and Alister hit the mute
button on the cell phone.  All three leaned towards the center of the
table to listen.

"...I've got some questions concerning the credit worthiness of
one of your business customers, Robotics Research.  They've
past due in their payments to us; we may go to court and get a
lien.  I spoke with you about three months ago, and I'd appreciate
it if you'd give me a call back..."

The three sat in silence until the call ended.  Alister spoke first.

"Do you have the money?"

"Yeah, we've got the money," Marc answered.

"Then why don't you just pay them?"

"Because we've got other things we need the money for."

"Like what?"

"Like your tenderloin, so eat it," Burns cut in, reaching across the
table with his knife and tapping the South African's plate for emphasis.


T - 54 days

An entire side of the two story warehouse was taken up by large
stainless steel tanks, interconnected with various machines by a
complex system of plumbing that ran across the ceiling.  Various
blueprints, rulers and small engine components were spread across a
series of tables arranged haphazardly throughout the room.  A
discarded rocket engine, with a large crack down one side, lay propped
against the far wall.  About five latinos, busy working on one piece
of equipment or another, ignored the two Caucasians as they entered.

"This is where we're building the rocket engines," Burns explained.
"The entire nozzle and combustion chamber is fabricated as one
monolithic piece, and a lot of the plumbing, too.  First, we cut
cross-sectional patterns out of ceramic fiber and stack them up to
form the engine shape."

He lead the South African to one of the large tables as he spoke.  On
it were bits and pieces of a black fabric that looked like course wool.
Next to the table was an automated cutting machine controlled from a
computer on the table.  A large roll of the fabric lay on the other
side of the machine, and one the workers was supervising it as it ran.

The cutting was done by an industrial laser in a moving mount about
two feet above the table, its beam pointed straight down at the sheet
of fabric laid flat on the table beneath.  The laser moved left and
right on a thin horizontal beam that moved forward and backwards, all
under computer control.  The net result was that by positioning the
horizontal beam with one servo motor, and positioning the laser along
the beam with another, the computer could aim the laser at any point
on the table below.

"Don't stick your hand in there!"  Burns joked.

The laser was cutting a piece of fabric as they approached, and the
smell of burning fiber wafted up into the air as a thin but steady
stream of smoke rose up from where the pencil-thin red light touched
the black fabric.  The laser moved slowly around the pattern, cutting
a thin line through the fabric as it went, its position indicated by a
red dot on the computer screen on the table to its left, which showed
a graphic animation of the pattern being cut.  The cuts were a
concentric series of near-circular gray lines, and the areas between
the lines were colored yellow and green on the display.  As they
watched, the computer completed cutting one of the lines.  The laser
shut off briefly as it repositioned to the next line, then turned on
and began cutting again.

"The yellow areas are discards," Burns explained, kicking at a pile of
scrap fabric underneath the table for emphasis.  "Each of the green
areas is a thin cross-section of the rocket engine.  There's 231 of
them in total.  They get stacked up in order in this graphite mold."

He walked past the laser cutter and showed Alister a large, solid
black casing covered with soot.  Rectangular on the outside, it opened
in two halfs to show the outline of a rocket engine cut out within.

"After a complete set of fabric cross-sections are in the mold, we
close it, compress it down, and put it in the kiln."

The kiln was a shiny steel tank that reached nearly to the roof
of the building.  Much of the facility's plumbing came into it.
An entire side of the tank swiveled open to reveal electric
heating coils, as well as various valves and gauges.

"We turn on the kiln and start pumping hydrogen and MTS gas into its
bottom."

"MTS?" Alister asked, unfamiliar with the acronym.

"Methyl trichlorosilane.  It's stable at room temperature, but starts
reacting with hydrogen at about a thousand degrees Celsius.  Decomposes
into silicon carbide and hydrogen chloride.  The silicon carbide is
deposited as a solid into the gaps between the carbon fibers; that's
why we use such a course fabric.  It's the silicon carbide we're
really interested in; it's stable until almost 3000 degrees Celsius,
and that makes it ideal for rocket construction.  Once the entire
fabric has been filled in with silicon carbide, we shut down the
kiln, crack open the mold, and take out our new rocket engine!"

They walked towards the rear entrance of the building, where a pile of
black ceramic pieces lay against one wall.  Burns picked up one of
them and handed it to his student.

"That's what it looks like when it's done.  If you look closely,
you can just barely see where the fabric was layered, but it's
really hard to tell."

Alister took the piece in his hand.  It was heavy and dense, smooth
and curved on its front and back surfaces, with ragged, sharp edges
around the sides.  Several larger pieces in the pile were clearly
broken parts of a rocket engine, and Alister concluded that the entire
pile had once been an engine as he tossed the piece back.

"What happened to that one?" he asked.

"It blew up when we test-fired it," Burns replied.  He continued his
explaination as Alister looked at him sharply.  "The Mexicans didn't
do a good enough job of aligning the fabric pieces.  They learned the
hard way."

They walked out the back of the building onto the flat dirt mesa.
Burns continued straight ahead, towards a black rocket engine mounted
horizontally and aimed away from the complex, across the empty expanse
of scrub brush.

"This is the firing stand.  We test each rocket after it's finished.
We just fired this one this morning."

They walked around the rocket.  Laid on its side, it was about equal
in height to the two men.  Alister peered into its business end and
was surprised to see what appeared to be fan blades mounted on a shaft
that extended out into the nozzle from the combustion chamber.  The
blades, along with the shaft, were made from the same black ceramic
material as the rocket itself.

"I've seen these fan blades on jets, but I didn't know rocket engines
had them," he noted.

"As far as I know, this is the only rocket design that does.  See,
one of the problems with liquid-fueled rocket engines is that you need
to inject the fuel under pressure.  That implies a pump of some kind,
and the rocket exhaust is the obvious thing to power it with.  Most
liquid-fuel designs syphon off some of the exhaust into turbo pumps on
the side of the rocket.  I played around with that, but it was a huge
pain.  So I decided to just stick a simple turbine in the nozzle and
drive the pumps with that shaft."

"So you, like, designed a whole new engine yourself?"

"Pretty much."

"Why didn't you just use an existing design; wouldn't that have been
simpler?"

"Well, yes and no.  A lot of this stuff is new, like the ceramics, for
example.  When they designed the space shuttle engines back in the
70s, they didn't have silicon carbide, at least not like this.  That's
one of the reasons they didn't put turbine blades right in the exhaust
stream - the materials couldn't handle the heat."

"So what did they use for materials?"

"A lot of the early rocket designs used copper, beleive it or not."

"Copper?  Wouldn't it just melt?"

"It does if you don't cool it.  They used copper because it conducts
heat so well.  So then you have to surround your engine with cooling
pipes and pump either water or liquid oxygen or something through 'em
fast enough to keep the metal walls cool enough so they don't melt."

"No shit?"

"No shit.  And then there was the turbo pump design - they used metal
blades, and _they_ had to be cooled, so you ended up putting little
holes through middle of the blades so you could run cooling fluid
through the turbine fan...  It gets to be a real pain."

They were now walking back towards the building complex.  Alister was
feeling a bit overwealmed, but Burns kept talking about rocket engine
design, continuing on about how he had used an array of 256 computers
to simulate the heat transfer properties of the engine in order to
design its mounting arrangement.  Apparently the silicon carbide could
get quite hot.  The young South African had basically tuned out, but
realized at that moment that the pot-smoking American was absolutely
the most brilliant engineer he had ever met.

The story broke on Wall Street that morning.  Marc quickly decided on
damage control and agreed to appear on CNNfn.  He lied through his
teeth.

"If they control Cisco, they control the network."

----

"OK, so we'll take the most lethal mix of the computer viruses we
stole from Network Security, transmit them encrypted to the Ciscos so
they won't be detected in transit, then program the machines to dump
them all out onto their network segments at a given time."

----

"The FBI computer network was essentially crippled today by what
government leaders are calling the most devastating act of
cyberterriorism yet perpetrated."  Similarly read the first statement
of almost every TV news program that evening.  On this particular
broadcast, the first clip was of FBI director Louis Freed giving an
interview.

"What happened today would be akin to someone breaking into the
Centers for Disease Control, taking a test tube of each of the most
lethal viruses there, mixing them all in a beaker and throwing it out
in the middle of New York City."

Later that day, someone sent an email to the NBC news desk that gave
instructions for contacting the criminals behind the latest string of
assults.  It prescribed use of a particular Cisco router, behind which
lay an elaborate string of ruses, redirectors and trap doors.  The end
result was an audio stream containing a computer synthesized voice
that would answer questions being broadcast live on national TV.  That
evening, the voice was interviewed by the network's national news
anchor.

"First," the voice began, "Director Freed's analogy of releasing Ebola
viruses in New York City is absurd.  In such an attack, thousands of
people would die.  In this case, I'd be amazed if even a single person
died as a result of the FBI network being crippled."

"But there were millions of dollars of damage done, correct?"

"Millions of dollars of what?  Computer expert's overpaid $200-an-hour
consulting fees?  Maybe.  But actual damage to physical hardware that
needs to be pulled out and replaced?  Probably zero."

The government responded quickly and harshly.  President Bush held a
press conference the next evening in which he addressed the nation,
informed the people that the United States was under attack from a
group of terrorists, and that the government was responding
accordingly.

The programers at Robotics Research were a different story.  Marc
wanted to keep some of them, so decided to drop the bomb.

"So let's have a red alert right now," Marc added.  Some of the people
in the room started to fidget.  Nobody other than the principals had
any idea what a "red alert" was.

"OK," Burns agreed.

"All right," Marc said, turning back to the room.  "We're going
to tell you everything, that is, those of you who want in on it."

"Want in on what?"

"What we're really trying to do here."

"So how much of what they're saying is true?"

"Pretty much all of it.  All the money is stolen, we ripped off the
venture capitalists for everything we could get out of them.  Those
of you who want to hear more stick around; the rest of you..." Marc's
voice trailed off and his motioned to the door.

Most of the people in the room got up and left.  One guy asked about
getting a last paycheck.  Mercurio grinned and shook his head.  "So
basically we've been working for free the last two weeks?  You'll
be hearing from my lawyer."

Less than a dozen stayed on to hear the explaination.  Burns was glad
to see Mike among them.  Kim chipped in, "I always thought something
was funny about this place," she said.  "None of the software we've
been working on has anything to do with a robotic kitchen."

Martin stuck around because he could.  Nobody was going to jail him
for listening, and who knew, there might be something in it for him,
if whatever scheme they were working on could produce enough money.

"So why have we been working on all this crazy stuff?" Mike asked.

"Because this company is a front.  It isn't a dot-com startup.  It's a
manned mission to Mars."

Martin sat back in his chair.  "Tell me more."  A wide grin broke
across Mike's face.  "Hell yea!"

A "red alert" simply meant that they were now within one month of
launch, a final countdown.  The plan called for almost all of their
operations to be shifted to the location know as Site Blue.  Mercurio
insisted that the equipment at Robotics Research be packed and shipped
within twenty-four hours.  Burn's kids worked through the night and
were gone by 7 A.M.  Mercurio left a simple, typewritten notice taped
to the door:

   Gentlemen,

Alister turned the van off the Interstate near where he had gone rock
climbing last year and floored it.  He knew the cop, or P.I, or
whatever he was wouldn't be far behind.  Let him eat dust for a while.
After carooming across the desert for about ten miles, he turned off
on a dirt road that didn't look like much, but actually wound around
and came back to a U.S. highway about twenty miles further on.  He
remembered the road well, and sped down it until it dipped into a
gully where you had to slow down to go over a rocky dry streambed,
then turned to the right and climed back towards the mesa.  Alister
took the streambed way faster than he should have, then slammed on the
brakes as soon as the van was out of sight past the turn.  Leaving the
engine running, the young programmer jumped out of the cab and ran
back towards the streambed.  He watched the dust cloud from his
pursuer's car as it sped closer, then ducked down into the drainage
ditch along the side of the road and scrambled closer to the turn.

XX slowed his car and drove across the streambed.  Though he had lost
sight of the van, he could still see its dustcloud, so he figured it
couldn't be too far in front of him.  Furthermore, even if he lost
them, whereever they were taking the equipment probably wasn't too far
- otherwise, why were they driving down this back road?  He was
starting to think a little more about that when he pulled out of the
streambed at twenty miles an hour and rounded the bend.  The van was
stopped about fifty yards ahead of him.  Almost at the same instant,
Alister ran up to his open driver's side window and landed a left jab
that broke XX's nose and sent him spawling across the Chrystler's
front seat.  The car swerved across the road and crashed into the
brush.  Alister yanked up the door lock and pulled the door open, as XX
drew the snub-nosed semi-automatic he kept in a holster strapped to
the small of his back.  Alister jumped him and brief but unequal
struggle insued.  Twenty years younger, having spent the summers of
his youth playing water polo in the pools of South Africa, and having
the element of surprise, Alister overpowered the detective and
withdrew from the car, pistol in hand.

"You don't want to kill me," XX told him in a matter-of-fact voice
that hid the fear wealing up inside of him.  How could he have been
so stupid?  He had badly misjudged these people; he thought they
were just white-collar criminals.

"You're wrong about that, mate," Alister replied, "but I'll settle for
putting a few holes in your radiator."

The programmer emptied the pistol into the Chryster's radiator,
which began hissing and belched forth a cloud of white steam.
They he ran back to the van, cruised down to the U.S. highway,
and turned back towards the Interstate.

The police raided two days early.  The "heads up" from the cop turned
out to be deliberate misinformation.  The police bust into the ranch
house early morning, and caught everyone asleep, except Burns, who
was smoking dope and watching TV.

"Where Mercurio?" a detective asked him after rounding up the programmers.

Burns shrugged, "not here".

The rest watched on CNN.  "Maybe they'll let 'em go, when they find out
they're small fish."  "With all this Homeland Security crap?  They had
'em locked up tigher than a drum."

Mercurio slapped him hand on the table.  "Fuck it.  I said I wouldn't
let 'em hang out there, and I'm not letting 'em hang.  We'll go get
'em with the choppers."

"How, they're already arrested?"

"We'll hold up the cops.  Surprise 'em as they move our people to
the jail."

"I'll go," Brian said.  Marc started to object.  "No, I told you you
needed someone for security, and this is exactly what I meant."

Mercurio led the raid.

Vic went along, but said he was a doctor and wasn't going to use a
weapon.

They went down in CH-47 Chinooks, sat the choppers down on an empty
mesa twenty miles away.

"Take this!" Marcelius yelled at Vic and shoved an M-16 at him.

"No!" the doctor answered and backed off.  "I'm not using one of those
things!"

"Just take it and aim it at the cops!"

"No!"

"Look!  I need a show of force.  I've got to look like I'm in control!
Now, take a gun and hold it at the police!"

, and waited for the TV to show the police driving out.
As soon as they hit the road, the choppers were in the air.

Brian shot out the lead cop car's engine and jumped onto the ground,
pointing an M-16 at the driver's head.

"Hands on the wheel, now!"

...

"We need another week or two at least."

"We're out of options.  This place is all we've got left."

"So you need a diversion," Brian summerized.  "I'll take care of it."

Over the next week, Brian blazed a trail of blown-up highway bridges
across the country.  Marc continued to phone in to the various media
outlets, and quickly became dubbed the "Highway Bomber".  The manhunt
dominated the national headlines, but Brian kept right on going,
across Kansas, across Missouri, into Tenneesse, and up through
Virginia towards Washington, D.C.  His destination was obvious, and
nobody paid Utah any attention at all.  The nation's capital was put
on a terrorist alert.  Part of the reason he was so successful is that
all the pictures on the TV were Marc's, so Brian was able to drive
the highways unmolested.

That all changed in Roanoke, Virginia.  Two deer hunters came across
Brian as he waited for the traffic to clear on his latest target, a
highway bridge on Interstate 95.  The hunters opened fire.  Brian
fired back, ran back to his Jeep and sped away, but not before the
hunters had gotten his license plate numbers and a good description of
the Highway Bomber.  The police now knew they had a second suspect and
shifted their focus accordingly.  The public was told this unknown man
was "armed and extremely dangerous" and were advised to report to the
police immediately any sitings.  Brian called Marc on his cell phone.

"I think my cover is pretty much blown here."

"OK, can you make it back out west without being followed?"

"I don't think so."

"Fine, can you just disappear for a while?"

Brian thought for a minute.  He had friends in Maryland.  Would
they hide him from the police?  "I think so."

"OK, just do that.  Lay low for a couple of weeks until I can
get this launch off, then split for South America once all the
attention has shifted to me."

"No.  No.  Estes missiles voy a espacio.  Espacio!  Espacio!"  Marc
pointed to the sky for emphasis.

"A las noticas dicen que usted es un terroristo."

"He says they're saying on the news that you're a terrorist."

"No.  No!  Amigos!  Tu sabes yo!  Yo no terroristo!"

"Has sido explotando las puertas en Virginia."

"He says you've been blowing up bridges in Virginia."

"Como se dice es posible yo... BOOM... in Virginia?  Yo estoy agui!"

"Alguien ha sido explotando las puertas en Virginia."

"He says somebody's been blowing up bridges in Virginia."

Marc shrugged his shoulders and paused for a moment, his mouth agap.

Vic asked Andrea to go to the fuel company and check it out.  She met
the management team, was shown around the headquarters facility, and
told that the gate way down the road led to another property.

She took a moment in the lady's room as an excuse to walk around,
try all the doors, find one unlocked, open it, walk in and begin
looking through the file cabinet.  She opened one drawer and pulled

Suddenly, the light came on. She slamed shut the folder, shoved it
awkwardly back into the filing cabinet, and spun around to find the
Captain watching her from the doorway.  He smiled sarcastically.

"Can I help you?"

Andrea took a deep breath.  She was no spy, no matter what government
agency she worked for.  She decided on honesty.  Puting down the
papers, she turned fully back around to the door and put her hands on
her hips.

"What are you up to?"

"Why don't you tell me what you think I'm up to?  Why don't you give
me your expert analysis of... whatever it is you're reading?"

"It looks like you've got some kind of orbital launch planned, I'd
say probably manned."

Bryan appeared in the door behind Marcelius just in time to hear the
last part.  The Captain smiled broadly and walked completely into the
room.

"Would you come with us, please?"

Andrea looked back at the man who just arrived.  Suddenly,
instinctively, she knew in her heart that he could completely dominate
in any physical confrontation, that she might as well have been in the
presence of two or three police officers.

"What if I don't want to?"

Bryan spoke for the first time.

"You're coming with us, and you can come however you please."





Launch Day

With rockets launching every 5 minutes, Mercurio finally started
to give honest answers to the media.

"How much money did you steal?"

"Hard to say.  Adding up everything we lied about, everything we
bought on empty credit, everything we just flat out stole - probably
close to a billion dollars."  He paused for a minute.  "And that's a
shoestring budget for what we're trying to do.  We've cut a lot of
corners.  A billion isn't much for a manned space launch, let alone
one going to Mars."

"How many corners did you cut?"

"A bunch.  I'd like to have three identical ships going, but we've
only got one.  We don't have any kind of landing vehicle yet, and
of course I'd like to have one built already and tested here on Earth,
but that isn't going to happen either."

"How do you plan to land on Mars if you don't have a landing vehicle?"

"We've got an old 747 we managed to put in orbit this morning, and
I'm hoping we can modify it to function as a space shuttle."

"How much do you have of... uh, supplies?"

"We've got a year's supply of food, water, charcoal to extract carbon
dioxide from the air.  Then we'll have to start recycling."

"Do you expect to be gone longer than a year?"

"Of course, yes.  There's no way we could get to Mars and back in a
year.  Plus, I'm planning on making a stop at the astroid belt on the
way.  I'm looking at five years..."

Brian jogged into the room.  "We've got a problem.  Looks like Alister's
ship hit something and sprung an oxygen leak."

"Shit.  OK, I've got to go.  Gentlemen, I'll talk to you later."

They walked back into the makeshift control room, and listened in
to the radio traffic.  Burns was pretty much in charge, but there
wasn't much he could do at the moment.  Alister's ship had
quickly lost all its atmosphere, but both astronauts were safely
inside their spacesuits.

"OK, Mercurio here," the captain announced into the radio, as he
glanced behind himself and noticed the TV crew that had followed
them.  Probably live on CNN, he thought, which they were.

"Burns, can we rendevous with Alister ASAP and just get them
off that ship onto one with an atmosphere?"

"Yeah, that'll work.  They're on the other side of the planet from
me.  Alister, can you make it to, uh... cargo module 14?  It's got
an airlock on it, and you can just push all the stuff aside and
wait there for us."

"Right on, no problem."

"How's it look, Alister?" Mercurio interjected.

"It's fine, chief.  It was a great ride up, and think the leak won't
be too much of a problem.  We're already looking around to try
and find the hole."

"OK, I'll see you on orbit.  Mercurio out."

"No possibility of an abort?" Brian ventured.  His old friend shook
his head.  "OK, let's go."

Two policemen pushed past the camera crew.  "You're under arrest," one
stated in a command voice as he moved forward.  Brian dropped into a
ready position as the cop lunged forward to grab him.  The ex-Ranger
sidestepped, stuck out his arm against the policeman's chest, and
stepped threw the whole weight of his body forward.  The cop went
flying backwards and sprawled out on the floor.  The camera crew was
shocked, but not enough so that the pictures weren't carried live on
national TV.  Brian followed the captain as he backed out of the room,
towards the jeep parked in the back of the building.

"You son of a bitch," the policeman's partner sneered.

"This is your language," Brian replied, "the only one you understand."

They sped across the desert mesa towards the last rocket, police cars
with screaming sirens right behind.  Both police and news helicopters
hovered overhead, and the images were now being carried live on
practically every TV station in the country, as well as some in
Europe.  Stopping the jeep at the base of the rocket, they jumped
into the cable car and started the winch.  The police cars pulled up
at the base and the cops ran to the base of the tower, but the car
was already out of reach.

"If you want to stick around when we fire this thing up, be my guest!"
Marc yelled down to them, motioning towards the mamouth ICBM they
were now inching up.  At the top, Marc and Brian walked across the
catwalk and climbed into the cockpit.  Marc pulled the hatch shut
behind them and sealed it.  They had checked the radio earlier, and
Marc now clicked it on and called Burns.  He knew they didn't have
time for long checklists.

"We're ready to go."

One of the cops said something on his radio, then they all got in
their cars and headed back towards the compound.  "This is out of our
league; call for the feds," one of them told his partner.  Halfway
across the mesa, the ground shook as the solid fuel ignited in the
rocket behind them.




President Bush through the briefing folder across the room and
sent top secret papers flying everywhere.

"What the hell do I have a Department of Homeland Security for if
I've got to find out from CNN when 170 missiles get fired off in Utah?"

Once in orbit, the crew got right to work.  They had to.  Most of
their fuel and supplies were in the cargo modules, which were built
around a three-part design.  The first stage boosted the module to
orbital height and speed, though with a perigee still in the
atmosphere.  After detaching the first stage, the second stage fired
briefly at apogee to raise the module to a circular orbit, while the
first stage dropped back into the atmosphere and burned up.  Atop the
second stage was the cargo module itself, equiped with a laptop
computer using a radio communications link and a fuel cell fed
from supply lines of N-133 and peroxide.



T + 2 days

Burns had originally toyed with the idea of putting windows in some of
the cargo modules to let sunlight in for growing plants.  The time
factor had caused him to forego this in favor of solid, uncut cargo
modules and more than two hundred grow lights that he had simply
packed away, surrounded by almost a solid foot of styrofoam packing
peanuts to protect them against the bumpy ride up.  Due in large part
to their inefficient launch profile, all the lights made it.

Supplying them with power was a different story.  Burns had brought
four fuel cells capable of reacting the kerosene and the oxygen
produced from the hydrogen peroxide, albeit inefficiently, and mounted
two of them in the 747's pressurized upper deck.  They were supplied
with fuel from a pair of tanks in the rear of the 747.  Each tank
contained a diaphragm with pressurized air on one side and liquid fuel
or oxidizer on the other.  Especially in the micro gravity of Earth
orbit, little air pressure was required to keep the fluid flowing to
the fuel cells, and Burns had designed the tanks so he could force
more fuel into them from the plane's main fuel tanks by starting the
rocket engines and using the force of the thrust to force fuel back
into the tanks.  He also had several small tanks of fuel and oxidizer
that fit through the hatchways and could be used in emergencies.

But the real power would have to come from the solar panels.  The ship
just didn't have enough power to operate the grow lights so critical
for the ultimate success of the mission.  Moreover, if they continued
to use the power cells, they would eventually run out of fuel.
They had not brought enough fuel to both get to the astroid belt
and run the fuel cells the entire way.

So, the first week in orbit consisted almost entirely of orbital
operations, as Burns docked with one cargo module after another,
slowing refueling the 747 from the 30,000 L capacity of each module.
Along the way, he also assembled the cargo modules in a long chain
attached to the docking ring on the nose of the 747, which became
like a tugboat pushing a cargo barge around Earth orbit.

Despite all the work going on in orbit, Mercurio found time for
the media, and at that moment the stunning private space launch
was all the rage.  His first major appearance was on a prime-time
national news program.

"Captain, by all accounts you stolen millions of dollars, and many
people think you could have gotten away with at least several million
undetected.  Why not just take the money and retire on a beach in
Aruba?  Why fly into space?"

"Well, Jack, that's a good question.  I guess, basically, I'm 35
years old and not ready to lounge on a beach just yet.  Spaceflight
has always facinated me, and I want to do something with my life,
not just sit around and enjoy a big pile of cash."

"Couldn't you have raised money for your flight just by being
honest with people about what you were attempting, have say,
hey, we're flying to space, finance us?"

"No, I don't think so.  Look at the X Prize.  They were trying to
raise 10 million dollars to reward a private manned spaceflight and
struggled every step of the way.  Ten million is nothing; you'd be
lucky to get one man into orbit for ten million, heck, you'd be lucky
to put an unmanned satellite into orbit for ten million.  The only
manned space programs are funded by national governments with huge
bankrolls.  Other than that, you've got these commercial satellite
launches backed by large corporations with some kind of scheme to make
the money back, and plenty of those schemes fail.  Let's face it - in
a capitalist society the only way to get anything done is to have some
kind of money-making scheme, some kind of 'business plan', they call
it, and we've got no business plan of any kind for how you can recoup
a billion dollars from this flight or any other.  So the only way to
do it was to either wait for the government, or be independantly
wealthy, or steal it.  We stole it."

"What do you have to say to all the people you stole from, I'm sure
many of them are listening to this program, do you have anything to
say to them?"

"Not really.  We didn't steal from Mother Teresa.  The only people
we stole from were capitalists, and they won't lift a finger for
anybody unless they're getting something out of it for themselves."

"So you don't have a problem stealing from capitalists?"

"Why should I?  They're some of the most selfish people in the world,
heck, their whole philosophy is based on greed.  I'm mean, let's just
apply their own rational.  I'm helping them compete.  If some of them
go out of business, so what?  I'm developing technology to fly to
Mars, so the whole society benefits.  We rip and claw at each other
throats, and that drives civilization forward.  This is the capitalist
philosophy, isn't it?"

"Well, just to play the devil's advocate, I think a lot of people would
say that we play according to rules, and that you've broken those
rules."

"Who makes up the rules?  The capitalists."

"Well, the rules are made collectively, through a democratic process."

The captain paused a moment before answering.

"You make it sound like everyone agrees on these rules.  If that's the
case, then why do people blow up federal buildings, why do people
smash airplanes into skyscrapers, who do people burn this country's
flag?  Obviously, there's a lot of people who don't agree with these
rules, and frankly, I'm one of them."

"I think many people would say that even though we don't necessarily
agree with all the rules, we obey them anyway and work to change them
democratically."

"Sure, that's why everyone obeys the speed limit, because they're so
committed to obeying the rules.  Look, I don't buy any of that.
People obey the rules because they're forced to, because they're
afraid of what will happen to them if don't follow the rules."

"Well, that might be true in a dictatorship, but in a democracy?"

"How's it different?  It's just that the majority makes up the rules
and forces the minorities to obey.  They only thing that's different
about democracy is that it's a different group of people making the
rules.  In Russia it was the proletariat, here it's the majority."

"So do you see America as similar to the Soviet Union?"

"Very much so.  It's the same kind of trash that runs it."

"Meaning... the capitalists?"

"Sure.  The communist philosophy was based on brutal, cut-throat class
competition; the fascist philosophy was based on brutal, cut-throat
racial competition; the capitalist philosophy is based on brutal,
cut-throat individual competition.  It's basically the same thing,
slightly editted for a new generation, but the same kind of garbage in
charge of society.  And I feel as bad about ripping off the
capitalists as I would about ripping off communists or fascists,
because to me they're all basically the same.  Just another bunch of
men with some nightmare system to be jammed down everyone's throats.

"Well, captain, we're pretty much out of time.  Thank you for
being on the program, and I'm sure we'll talk to you again soon."


T + 5 days

Mercurio's next TV appearance was on a political talk show that
usually featured a panel discussion.  This evening the other
guests were a congressman and a prominent businessman, who
had heard his earlier interview and was determined to rebut him.

"The fact is that capitalism has produced a society with the highest
standard of living that has ever been seen on this planet.  People are
well-fed, well-housed, generally content with their jobs, with a
surplus of leisure time and disposible income.  And yet these
psuedo-socialists insist on slamming capitalism at every turn because
they can't stand the idea of people working hard and getting rewarded
for that hard work.  And now this man comes along, this criminal, who
has taken advantage of our society, stolen from our businesses, lied,
cheated; he comes on this program with the nerve to blame capitalism
for what?  For letting him take advantage of it?  For giving him the
opportunity to pull of one of the greatest con jobs in history?"

Mercurio retorted without waiting for the host to invite him.

"That's quite a nice speech.  The communists also had their speeches.
They loved to go off about how they had put the first man in space,
and how they had brought tractors and steel factories to this
backwards, feudal country, and how everyone was guaranteed a job, and
an education, and a retirement, and how wonderful communism was.  And
the fascists loved to talk about their Zeppelin airships, and their
autobahns, and how they had pulled Germany out of a worldwide
recession, and how they were rebuilding their Reich and how wonderful
fascism was.  And it's all true, but it all overlooks the simple fact
that every one of these societies is based on forced labor.  So if you
want Zeppelins, or Sputniks, or Microsoft Windows, and these material
things are more important to you than your freedom, then should pick
whichever one of these brutal philosophies most appeal to you and go
sign up."

"Ted, can I jump in here?" Congressman Black asked.

"Sure, go ahead," replied the moderator.

"Capitalism may not be perfect, and this society may not be perfect,
but what sets us apart from communism and fascism is our commitment to
democracy and freedom.  Those countries were dictatorships.  This
country is run by its people, through their elected representatives,
and the capitalists don't simply 'own' the government, and they don't
always get their way."

"Well, congressman, I'll agree with you that this is a democracy, but
I don't think that changes things more than a little.  Let's say
Russia had had freedom of speech, and freedom of the press, and free
and open elections every two or four years, and they had still elected
the communists, and still supported the KGB, and still shipped their
citizens off to gulags.  Would that have changed things all that much,
just that they had elections?"

"But we don't support the KGB, and we don't ship our citizens off to
gulags."

"Oh, but you do.  Haven't you heard about 'zero tolerance'?  Haven't
you heard about the War on Drugs?  You do ship your citizens off to
jail, and while you may not torture them, and your prisons may not be
as cold as the ones in Siberia, the fact remains that fear of the
police is just as readily used in this society as in those others."

"I don't think you can compare the DEA with the KGB."

"I do.  The basic premise is the same.  The solution to our problems
is to have a war against our own people, to send armed men busting
into the homes of people who have done absolutely nothing to harm
anyone, to make people so terrified of what will be done to them
that they will too afraid not to just fall in line and do what
they're told when the great majority barks out its orders."

"OK, sir, we have a Constitution..."

"So did they; so did they."

"Our Constitution is enforced.  Our Constitution restrains the power
of our government..."

"Really?  Let's take a look."

"Oh, please..."

"No, let's take a look!  You've made this absurd claim that our government
is restrained by its Constitution; let's get the thing out and take a look
at it.  Mr. Koppel, I think we can a copy of the Constitution faxed
around to the members of this panel."

"OK, but I'm not sure that's really the point of the discussion..."

"I do!  I think that's exactly the point!"

"OK, fine!"  Black interjected, determined not to be shown up.  "Let's
get a copy of the Constitution."

Mercurio was already ahead of him.  He grabbed his laptop, ran an
Internet search, pulled up the U.S. Constitution, and prepared to
start reading from it.

"Let's start with the powers of Congress.  Article one, section eight.
Now, congressman, stop me if at any point you hear anything about
regulating the use of drugs, or radio communications, or agriculture,
or the environment, or..."

"All right, all right, first of all, many of these problems didn't exist
two hundred years ago, there was no drug abuse, no radio, the environment
wasn't an issue..."

"So we should just ignore our Constitution whenever some new problem
comes up; it only applies to our old problems?"

"You want to go through the Constitution section by section?  How
about Ammendment One, Freedom of Speech; Ammendment Two, the Right to
Bear Arms; the guarantees of due process, the election procedures,
this is absurd!"

"What good's a law when you pick and choose what parts of it you want
to obey?  Fine, you obey parts of the Constitution, what about the
other parts?  This is like me blowing down the highway at ninety miles
an hour, and when the cop pulls me over saying, oh, but officer, I
came to a full and complete stop at all the red lights!"

"OK," Koppel interjected, trying to bring the discussion under
control.  "Congressman, Captain Mercurio certainly isn't the first
person to accuse the Federal Government of circuventing the
Constitution.  Is there nothing to any of these claims?"

"No, and I'll tell you why," Black replied.  "All these things the
anti-government people gripe about - gun control, the drug war, the
environmental laws, the Department of Homeland Security - all of them
are supported by the overwealming majority of the people of this
country."

"I'll agree with that," the space captain replied, "but I'd still like
to see these additional powers codified in Constitutional Ammendments,
and I'll tell you why.  One of the big accusations people made against
Soviet Russia was that their government didn't obey their
Constitution.  I don't want anybody being able to come around a
hundred years from now and try to say that it wasn't really a
democracy, that people didn't really want these things, that some
bunch of politicians took over the government.  This government, this
majority, talks so much about law and order, is so determined to make
all these rules for everyone else to obey, I'd just like to see them
have to obey the rules that were laid down for them.  It's a bit of a
side issue, but I'd really like a precedent established that the
powers of the government are limited by the Constitution."

"So you actually do think the majority of people support the government?"

"Yes.  The problem is populist government - this stupid idea that you
can put the masses in charge of society.  It was talked about by
philophers in the eigthteenth century, brought to power in Europe and
the Americas by a string of revolutions in the nineteenth century, and
brought to fuition in the twentieth century.  What it produced was
fascism, communism, and capitalism - three of the most depraved
societies that have every been seen on the face of this planet.
Fascism, based on brutal, viscious, racial competition; communism,
based on brutal, viscious, class competition; and capitalism, based on
brutal, viscious individual competition.  Now, tell me, what do all of
these things have in common... other than the fact that millions upon
millions upon millions of people went chasing off after every one of
them?"

"The problem with communism wasn't their economic system, it wasn't
the structure of their elections, it wasn't their lack of
constituional guarentees.  The problem with communism was that their
leaders were a bunch of trash with some nightmare system to be jammed
down everyone's throughts.  They were a lot like the people who run
democracy today."

"The problem isn't Bill Gates.  The problem is John Doe.  Walk into
one of these stores anywhere in the Western world without a credit
card or a twenty dollar bill in hand.  Ask for a plate of food.  See
how much you walk out with."

"Well, that's perfectly understandable.  If you just give away to
everyone, you'll be put out of business."

"That's right!  That's the 'freedom' of democracy right there - you be
a capitalist or you'll be put out of business.  And then if you won't
work for these bums, you'll be put homeless and starving on the street
and all these great, decent people will spit on you as they walk past
and call you a bum who doesn't want to work... And they're right,
'cause I don't want to work - for them and their brutal system!"



"The majority don't want good leaders," Marc cut in.  His advesary
stuttered and faltered.  "The majority don't want good leaders," the
astronaut repeated, floating weightless on the screens of 10 million
people watching the live interview on Nightline.  "They want garbage
leaders.  They want the most selfish bastards you'd ever want to meet,
with this nightmare capitalist system based on the most vicious traits
of mankind to be jammed down everyone's throughts.  And this time,
nobody can say it isn't really a democracy, that one man took over the
government, that the discedents were 'disappeared', that we don't have
freedom of speech or freedom of the press.  Nobody can claim that this
isn't really what the majority of people want.  Democracy is another
communism."

"Another communism?" Koppel cut it, stunned.  "That's right," Marc
replied, before backpedeling... slightly.  "I don't mean that it's
murdered millions of people, or enslaved half the planet, but it's
another big pile of books and theories that sound real good on paper,
and in practice has produced one of the most depraved societies that's
every been seen on the face of this planet.  People will look back on
this a hundred years from..."  It was more than the congressman could
take.  Visibly redening, now it was his turn to cut off the space
captain.

"Look here, democracy may not be perfect, but it's a damn sight better
than just about anything else out there.  In the last 200 years, we've
abolished slavery, and that alone has to count as one of the biggest
achieve..."  Mercurio cut right back in.  The debate had turned into an
intellectual free-for-all.

"The communists abolished slavery, too.  That isn't the point.  The point..."

"Yes it is the point!  Yes it is! Don't go brushing off everything
this country's accompished just 'cause you can't see anything but it's
faults!  We're not perfect, but the majority of this country's people
are decent, hardworking people who want a better life not just for
themselves, but for decent people everywhere!"

The congressman paused for breath, and Koppel chose this moment to
jump in and try to bring the debate back under control.  He decided to
do it by challenging one of the astronaut's more dramatic
claims. "Gentelmen, please.  Captain Mercurio, many people critize the
United States, but another communism?  You can't be serious."

"Look here, it's the same with all these populist governments,"
Mercurio replied.

"Populist?" the congressmen retorted.

"Yes, populist," the spaceman replied.  "Communism was one of the
biggest populist movements of the twentieth centry.  Millions upon
millions upon millions of people 'believed' in communism.  And they
beleived in it for the same reasons that millions of people in Germany
beleived in fascism, and that millions of people today believe in
capitalism..."  The spaceman paused before letting his bombshell drop.
"...because it's brutal as hell, and that's what 'works' in the 'real
world', and that's what all these millions and millions of people
'know'!"

Congressman Black looked like he was ready to reach through the TV
monitor and rip the spaceman's head off.  He replied in clipped,
measured tones that betrayed the rage he felt at his floating nemisis.

"Communism was a brutual, murderous dictatorship.  And I want to be
very clear on that word - dictatorship.  There was nothing populist
about it in the least."

"Nothing populist about communism?  Then how did it manage to take
over half this planet?  It was the same with the Nazis, elected in
1932, and yes, despite every attempt to claim the contrary, the were
_elected_; France, the French Revolution, whose leaders talked about
liberty, fraternity, and equality, then built guilateons in the public
squares of Paris and chopped off the heads of the nobelmen.  Europe's
first democracy - and every one of those men was elected - Coulton,
Saint Just, Robspierre, and of course, finally, Napoleon."

"Napoleon was elected?" Black sneered.

"He could have been.  He could have won any election in that country.
Bonaparte was one of France's most popular leaders."

"This has been the broken record of democracy for the last two hundred
years.  All these people talk about these grandeose ideas of liberty
and freedom, and then choose absolute garbage for their leaders, and
build societies based on the basest and most vicious traits of
mankind.  This time around it's the capitalists - the most selfish
sons of bitches you'd ever want to meet, and the majority support
these bums every step of the way.  The majority of people are
completely incapable of choosing anything but the worst possible
leaders."

Mercurio stopped, and Black didn't retort immediately.  A tense silence
fell over the teleconference.  Across the country, millions of people
in their homes murmorred amongst themselves.  "I don't want to hear
any more of this."  "You tell 'em, Marc!"  "That bastard deserves to
die up there!  I hope the whole bunch die!"  "Is this what people
think about us?"

"How is it different?  How is what Saddam Huissen tried in Kuwait all
that much different from Andy Jackson's stunt in Flordia?"

"Oh please... it's not even close."

"What?  He just walked in and took Flordia.  It was Spanish territory
and he just walked in and took it."

People were already cutting him off.  "For starters, Andrew Jackson
wasn't a mass murder who unleased chemical weapons on his civilian
population."

"But from a standpoint of international law?"  Again, others started
cutting in, but the space captain wouldn't let them change the subject.

"From a standpoint of international law, how was it different?  And
then democracy gets all high-and-mighty 'We're fighting for a small
country being pushed around by a big one' - What about Panama?  When
we walked in and just took over the country, threw its president in a
Flordia jail, and installed our own government.  Who was there to
fight for a small country being pushed around by a big one then?"

"Manuel Noreiga was an international drug dealer..."

"An international drug dealer who just happened to be the president
of a soverign nation..."

"It was not a legitamite government.  It was not a legitamite government.
It was a military junta, and the people of Panama packed the streets
and cheered when our troops liberated their nation."

"Of course they cheered.  They cheered in Cuba - haven't you seen the
pictures of Castro's tanks rolling down the streets of Havana?  They
cheered in Moscow, they cheered in Beijin - the 'people' always cheer
when their 'heros' show up with their tanks and guns.  And just what
is a legitamite government, anyway?"

A pause fell over the broadcast, and Mercurio repeated his question.
"What is a legitamite government?"

"A democratically elected body with the support of the people."

"You mean the support of the majority?"

"Well, the people are..."

"The people are the majority?  And what about the minority?  I guess they're
not people, hugh?"

"The rights of the minorities have to be protected, but the overwheling
majority of people support democracy, even if they don't win a particular
election..."

"Of course they support it - they're the majority!  Basically, the only
legimitate form of government is democracy, right?  Everything else is
illegimiate, and if your government is illegimiate, you basically have
no rights, there is no international law for you, so better buddy up
with the U.S. or you might find the SEALs airdropping on your airport
one morning."

"So we should have just let Saddam Hussien take over Kuwait?"

"Basically, yes, just stay out of it."

"And next will be Saudi Arabia, and then Israel..."

"Israel can take care of themselves, and the Saudis, if they really
want their government, they can fight to keep it.  I mean, basically,
democracy is the _greatest-system-of-government-on-earth_, so it does
pretty much whatever it pleases, right?"

  -- And what about Israel?"

"Well, captain, how would you suggest we deal with the Palestinian
issue, and the Midest Peace Process?"

"Well we were real generous back in '52 with someone else's land,
weren't we?  Why don't we just give the Jews Manhattan Island - that's
their Promissed Land, isn't it?"

"That is absurd, and border-line racist, I might add."

"Why?  Because the Mossad would end up headquarted in the Empire State
Building and the blacks would start an intafadda after being
'resettled' in the Upper East Side?  You're right, it's totally
absurb.  The U.S. would never stand for it."



In New York, Koppel decided to change the subject, since the broadcast
was nearing it's end.  There would be plenty more opportunities for
debate.  "Captain, what are your plans?  How long can you stay in
orbit?"

Mercurio rumaged in a storage bin and sent clothes flying all over
the compartment.  Finally, he pulled out the T-shirt he was looking
for, brushed a pair of jeans away from the TV camera and spread
the black T-shirt out so it dominated the view field of the camera.
It read: FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING FUCKS.

"We're going to Mars!"

All of NASA's top project managers were at the meeting.  The shuttle
was scheduled to go up in two weeks, and they had to figure if
Mercurio's unexpected launch would affect anything they were doing.

"They'll never make it.  We better have the shuttle ready for a
rescue."

"Hell with 'em.  Let the bastards die up there."

Andrea spoke up.  "We have to help them."

"Help them?" the director asked, incredulous.  "They're criminals."

"That doesn't make a difference.  They're astronauts and we should do
whatever we can to help them.  God knows, they're going to need it."

Johnson's director leaned forward onto the table.  "Why should we
help a bunch of theives and terrorists that have stolen millions
of dollars and destroyed something like a dozen Interstate highway
bridges?"

"Because it's the Christian thing to do."

Somebody sneered, and the director grimised. "Well, it doesn't matter.
If we do anything to help them, the President'll have my head in an
hour."

"Then stand up to him," Andrea shot back, starting to get a little ruffled.

The director guffauled.  "Stand up the President?  Be my guest.  You
stand up to him.  I want to keep my job.  Meeting adjourned."

"Does the media have a conservative bias?" McLauchlin asked the
TV camera.

"On a scale of one to ten, how conservatively biased is the news media?"

"Zero.  OK, maybe one.  The media just reflects the opinions of the people."

"I'll go with a three."

"The answer is - three."

A problem quickly develops.  They've overlooked the need for a meteor
shield and quickly suffered several metor hits.  They deal with the
problem by putting the damaged modules in front of the others, and
some begin talk of a rescue mission and how much it will cost NASA,
and this is why we need regulation, etc, etc.  The Captain decides to
break orbit and head higher, away from LEO, but they'll be beyond the
shuttle's range for a rescue.  Meanwhile...


T + 17 days

Pipi had been fairly quiet and sullen after the Nightline interview.
He continued to do his work, quietly, efficiently, but his opinion of
the captian had irrevokably changed.  He had known him as a driven
man, but had thought he was driven by a thirst for adventure and
exploration.  Now he saw something different - a man driven by rage,
by anger, by thirst for an insane kind of revenge against a society he
hated.  In light of this, the risks of the mission began to loom
large, and the hardships they now faced, only a little more than a
hundred miles above Earth, drove doubt into him about anyone's chances
for survival.  Mercurio mentioned several more times that they could
still turn back, but nobody else seemed interested.  Burns largely
ignored politics and concentrated on doing his work, smoking his weed
afterwards, and playing loud rock music.  Vic didn't have as much to
do, but seemed to Pipi to harbor a kind of secret hatred of the world
that only occasionally surfaced.  Once, trying to feel him out, Pipi
asked him if he would want to go back to Earth.  "Over my dead body,"
came the reply, with a chuckle.

Finally, Pipi's simple desire for life won out, and his loss of
respect for the captain broke the man's hold on him.  He came to the
skipper while he was working alone one day on the water recycler, told
him he wanted out, and braced himself for an argument.  Yet Mercurio
wasn't that kind of man.  As angry and bitter as he could be while
confronted a distant representative of a hated society, he always
softened up in person.  "You want to think about this, or talk about
it?"  he asked.  "I have though about it, a lot," was Pipi's reply.
"I want to go home."  "I'll see what I can do," Marc replied, and
went back to his work.

Two days later, despite Pipi's misgivings, despite the heated exchange
on television, despite his own contempt for the world they now circled
above, the captain quietly demonstrated what, time and again, would
carry him and his crew through the loney and difficult years ahead.
He put his personal feelings aside to do what made sense for his
mission and his crew.  Over the last few weeks, he had accumulated a
small database of unlisted phone numbers.  He picked up the phone and
made one call.

The next day, Andrea Yeats pulled into the parking lot at Johnson
Spaceflight Center and started walked towards her office.  "Becker
wants to see you right away," Vou told her before she made it there.
She set her briefcase down next to her desk and headed across the way
to the director's office.  Lou was already there.  They were talking
as she came in.

"He doesn't want our help."

"True, but he wants us to do him a favor, and he's willing to do
a favor for us in return."

Lou looked up at Andrea.  "Looks like one of his crewman has gotten
cold feet.  The kid from California."  "Really?" Andrea replied as she
sat down, her heart racing.  Becker hadn't called her here just to
tell her something that would probably be on the news within days.
"Endevor is going up next month, and we've agreed to extend the flight
three days to redevous with them and retrieve this guy."  "Whose idea
was that?"  the engineer asked.  The reply can from Lou.  "Mercurio's.
He called us himself."  "Really?" she answered, with an interested
pout.  "That leaves him one down," she noted, her mind starting to
race ahead, but Becker continued before she could think that far.
"He's offered us the possibility of putting a NASA observer on the
flight."  He paused to let the impact of the statement sink in.
Andrea's heart jumped, her mouth opened slightly and her gaze panned
to Lou, who was looking her right in the eye.  "It's yours if you want
it."

"We still haven't decided on a name for the ship," Marc explained.

"Well, can I put my two cents in?"  "Sure"

"You've heard the story of Icarus?"

"Some greek hero, right?"  Mercurio replied, vaguely enough to betry
his failure to exactly place the name.

"The son of Daedalus.  The father built wax wings for them both
to escape prison, and Icarus flew too close to the sun, and his wings
melted," Brian interjected.

"That's right," Andrea afirmed, and a moment's silence fell on the group
before people started to chuckle.  Burns finally bust laughing out loud.
Mercurio smiled, and noted quietly that his crew had learned to laugh
at the insanity of their undertaking.


Two days later, the Icarus breaks orbit.  Mercurio moves the ship to a
six-hour orbit, basically solves the meteor problem this way, and the
crew gets to work.  They've brought supplies for a year before the
crops have to work.


T + 91 days

After three months in orbit, the constant TV interviews had died down
and the Icarus crew had settled into a kind of routine.  This day was
typical.  Burns led Alister into the branching tree of docked cargo
modules, rummaged in one for a moment or two, then pulled out the
box he was looking for, a brand-new Whirlpool automatic dishwasher.

"Will this work in orbit?" he asked.  Alister shrugged non-commitally.

"Find out," Burns said as he pushed the box towards the open hatch,
letting Alister slow its momentum and guide it into the docking nexus
before propelling it down towards the main body of the spacecraft.
While Alister starting pulling apart the styrofoam packing pieces,
Burns returned to organizing the various equipment that now filled the
cramped crew compartment.  The captain quickly joined in.

"Where do you want it?" he asked his chief engineer, taking a box of
reference books that Burns had pulled out for his last big project,
modifying the forward radar array to give better azimuth coverage.

"Put them back in L-9; you should find some space there," Burns
replied, refering to the cargo module into which he had moved
most of the books he had brought.  He had wanted to scan them
electronically, but as the time-fuel trade-off had shifted
towards burning fuel to save time, the scanning had been
postponed and the books stored into cargo modules.

Meanwhile, the South African had began removing the cover from
the bulky dishwasher.  Having examined its construction, he had
already concluded that it would just fill up with water and
spill over into the cabin when opened, so his first thought was
to install a vacuum suction to remove the water when the
machine was finished.

Andrea drifted into the com shack, where Burns was floating with a
laptop, fiddling the database code while a half-burnt joint drifted
nearby.  The arid smell of the marijuana smoke hung in the air, not
yet cleared out by the charcoal filters.  The joint had burnt out, but
Burns hadn't noticed yet, engrossed as he was in the Java code on the
screen.  Andrea shook her head.  At first, it disturbed her that Burns
worked on critical software while intoxicated, but the quality of all
his work was superb, and the captain didn't seem to care.  "He cranks
out his best code while he's highed up."

MUTE.

Burns looked up from the screen as the engineer drifted up and grabbed
a handhold.  "You've known him a long time, the captain?" she asked.

Burns nodded and pushed the laptop away.  It drifted across the module
and bumped into the wall.  "Since college.  We were both comp sci
majors.  I'd been in a couple of classes with him, but I didn't really
know him until I looking for a place to live and answered an ad in the
paper.  I started talking to him on the phone and suddenly realized
that I'd seen him in class, so I moved into the place.  We had a lot
of great parties that semester."

"What was he like?"

Burns was quiet for a minute.  "He's a lot different now than he was
in college.  Back then, all he wanted was a joint and a whiteboard and
he was happy.  Now, he's a lot more driven."  His shrug indicated that
he wasn't as happy with his new, driven friend.

"How did he get... driven?"

"I guess he did what he had to do to get by."

"Did he have to steal a hundred million dollars?  Blow up a dozen
highway bridges?"

"Hey, you don't get ahead in the world by being nice to people.  He
learned to be tough."  Burns paused for a moment.  "The guy I knew in
college wouldn't have got us to Mars."

"So why did you come along?"

Burns curled up and started laughing.  "Because I wanted to go to
Mars!"  he finally burst out.  "What did you say when they asked you -
let me think about it for a few days?"



T + 194 days

"You wouldn't have been using any alcohol or illegal drugs, would you?"

"No," Andrea replied, stiffling the anger she felt at the policeman's
leading question, "I haven't."  She was in Germany for a technical
conference, and been pulled over in her rental car after turning the
wrong way down a one-way street.  If the sign had been in German, she
probably would have understood it, but it was one of those idiotic
"international" pictograms with just a red circle and line.  So now
she was pulled over the side, parked behind a ludicrously small police
car with its funny sounding siren, being questioned by a German
policeman.

"Then how did I get into the driver's seat of your car?" he asked.

The anger vanished, and fear gripped Andrea, terrifying, unreasoning
fear.  How had he gotten into the driver's seat?  He sat there in the
car seat next to her, but somehow she was on the passenger's side.
She opened her month and started to stammer something, then caught the
policeman's eyes as they narrowed and a lewd smile crept onto his
face.  Oh my God, it's him.  Oh my God, not again, she thought as his
hand slid across towards her leg.  She couldn't move, couldn't breath,
couldn't talk, couldn't scream, couldn't do anything but sit terrified
as he moved to touch her... and woke up.



T + 388 days

The asteroid belt turned out to be a gold mine.  Burns had devised a
scheme to survey the asteroid belt using four cargo modules loaded
with fuel and piloted under radio control.  In addition to digital
cameras, each module was equiped a spectrographic imager he had bought
the pieces for on Earth and assembled and tested on the way out.  When
focused on part of an asteroid, it would use a rotating prism to break
apart the various wavelengths of light and sweep them across a light
sensitive phototransistor.  The output from the transitor would be
digitized and transmitted back to the ship, producing something like a
strip chart showing the relative intensity of light at each
wavelength.  The light intensity would dip sharply at frequencies
absorbed by the asteroid's material, and by comparing the charts
with the absorption spectrum of known materials, the crew could
estimate the probably mineral content of each asteroid.

The cargo modules were launched under radio control, while the Icarus
drifted in solar orbit a thousand kilometers from the nearest
asteroids.  From their ship, the humans piloted the unmanned modules
through the belt, focusing the spectrographs on parts of individual
asteroids.  After two weeks of surveying more than a hundred
asteroids, they struck paydirt - a deposit of what turned out to be
nearly pure silicon.

Mercurio split the crew into two teams.  Burns and Alister loaded a
week's worth of supplies into a cargo module and headed for the
asteroid with the silicon deposit.  The captain, NASA engineer and
doctor remained on the ship and continued the survey.  Burns stopped
at another asteroid en route to their target and tested various
schemes for retrieving the silicon.  He finally settled on explosives,
and proceeded to the surveyed asteroid, blew half of it apart with
shaped charges he and the South African planted during a series of
spacewalks, collected several dozen of the larger pieces of silicon
left floating in space, and headed back to Icarus.  It was a
groundbreaking accomplishment, and the video images relayed back to
Earth were broadcast on news programs throughout the world.

After returning to Icarus, Burns loaded the silicon into the same
cargo module he had outfitted in Earth orbit to build solar cells.
While the sizes and shapes of silicon crystal were more irregular than
the original ingots from Earth, and the purity wasn't quite as good,
the silicon turned out to be fine for solar cells, and the robot
manipulators they had started using in Earth orbit were now put to
work producing solar cells from the ample supply of Asteroid Belt
silicon.  After a few tweaks, the manufacturing software began to run
unattended and started turning out a new solar power array every day.
Within a week, the ship was running completely from solar power, the
fuel cells were shut down, and Mercurio began to wonder what they
could do with the solar arrays the robots continued to crank out at
what seemly a nearly fantastic pace.  Burns had already planned ahead.

After returning from another trip into the asteroid belt, this time
with a cargo module loaded with water ice, Burns piloted the ship
closer to the asteroids, moved one of the cargo modules to a crater on
a nearby asteroid, set up several of the new solar panels, and began
using the power to melt the ice and then split the resulting water
into hydrogen and oxygen.  He and Alister spent almost a month setting
up the fuel plant, and by the time they were done two more cargo
modules were docked in a shaded corner of the asteroid crater, slowly
filling with hydrogen and oxygen, which easily cooled into liquid
without either sunlight or an atmosphere to keep them warm.

Meanwhile, the first crops from the ship's vegetable garden ripened,
just as the supply of military rations was growing noticably short.
Vic set about devising a high-protein diet plan, and soy beans, which
had grown quite readily in zero-g, topped his list.  The doctor
prepared his first batch in the Burns-devised vegetable steamer, which
superheated a pressurized canister of water before releasing it into
the chamber containing the soy beans.  As it left the canister, the
water, already heated beyond its conventional boiling point, burst
into steam with a loud hizzing that attracted the attention of the
young South African in the next module.

"Soy beans?" Alister questioned, imagining the pressed blocks of
tofu he had habitually passed by in the supermarket.

"I rather like them steamed," Vic replied.

"I don't know about this, mate," the programmer quibbled as he
inspected some of the freshly picked raw beans.  "I'll eat it though,"
he quickly added.

"Ever been to a sushi restaurant?" Vic asked, with a raised eyebrow
that indicated he thought he knew something his friend didn't.

"Sure, I love sushi, it's great!  Got any tuna hand roll in there?"

"Nope, but you ever had those green beans they serve as appetizers?"

"Yeah," Alister replied, glancing back down at the soy pods in his
hand.  "That's what these are?"

The doctor nodded in assent as he opened the steamer and let some of
the cooked soy beans, along with an ample quantity of steam, float out
into the air.  The aroma of freshly steamed vegatables permeated the
air and quickly brought work to a standstill on a spaceship where
plastic-wrapped spaghetti pouches and freeze dried peaches had been
the norm for months.

"What have we got here?" the captain asked as he floated in with Burns
from one direction, almost simultaneously as Andrea entered from the
other side, where she had been calibrating instrumentation for an
upcoming survey run.

"Are these from the garden?" she asked.  "Great!"


T + 401 days

Burns and Alister had returned to the asteroid belt in one of the
modified cargo modules, with two more in tow, to install a new set of
chemical processing modules that would now produces tanks of pure
oxygen, mixed with gaseous neon, of which they had found a rare
frozen deposit.  They had been on site two days and were in the
middle of an EVA.

"OK, ease her in further."

Since the Icarus was close enough to avoid any noticable radio lag,
the Captain was controlling the module from the ship while the two men
floated near it in spacesuits.  In fact, he was several hundred
kilometers away.  Vic sailed into the bridge, grabbed for a handhold,
missed, and hit the Captain's arm just as he tapped the a joystick to
fire the maneuvering thrusters.  They fired at nearly ten times the
strength he had intended, in a bizarre direction that sent the module
crashing sideways into the one it was being docked with, with Alister
in the middle.  He pushed away from the asteroid, but couldn't keep
his arm from being pinned by the errant module against the other.

"Shit," the Captain said, hitting the control in the opposite
direction, and awkwardly easied the cargo module away.  Alister began
screaming and floated free, except for his teather.  Burns cut his own
teather, fire his suit thrusters, and zipped over to his friend, whose
was in agony.  He spacesuit was leaking air, as well.

"Get him into the airlock!" the Captain ordered, but Burns yelled
back,

"He'll never make it!"

The fracture was compound and the broken bone had ripped a hole in the
suit.  Air was pouring out, propelling the young man in crazy
directions as he turned from one side to another and bounced on the
end of the teather.

"Quit waving your arms!"  Burns yelled.

He now had firm grasp of the young man and made a quick decision.
Without saying another word, he shoved the bone back into the suit,
pulled apart the two sections of bone, and tried to snap them back
together somehow.  Alister freaked, screaming in pain, but the bone
was back in the spacesuit and Burns clamped his hand over the hole.

"Hold still!" Burns yelled again.

"You fucking hold still, you crazy Yank!  Oh my bloody hell!"

"Here, hold your other hand over the hole!"

Back on _Icarus_, the Captain quickly brushed off Vic's stumble
as an accident, and the doctor thankfully was able to forget
about it as he raced to his sick bay and starting assembling
anything he thought he'd need.  Andrea Yeats, without asking,
went to one of the other modified cargo modules and flipped
on its com system.

"I'm powering OTV 3."

"OK, Vic, Andrea's powering three."

"Got it", answered the doctor, as he pulled out of the sick bay
refrigerator the two pints of blood he had taken from Alister
earlier in the trip, along with two pints of the Captain's
matching O Positive.

"I'll need a refrigerator in the OTV," he noted into his microphone.

"I'm on it," Bryan said, heading into the crew quarters to throw
all the food out of one of the mini-fridges.

Meanwhile, Burns got Alister back into the pressurized safety of the
OTV, but he had lost a lot of blood and was now unconscious.  Vic told
him to touranquit the wound, but had serious doubt that the Alister
would live for the day it would take them to manuerver through the
asteroids with the preasuse blood.  He shared his concerns privately
with Andrea as she released the hydraulic moaring clamps and backed
the OTV away from the _Icarus_ docking port.

Turning the OTV towards the asteroid belt, she engaged its main engine
and let it burn.  She kept it on far beyond the point where she could
stop the ship before reaching the first asteroids.

"What are you doing?" the Captain asked from the bridge, watching her
speed continue to increase on the computer-generated plan position
display in front of him.

"Every play _Asteroids_?" she asked.

Over the next half hour, she caroomed through the asteroid belt at
breakneck speed, never stopping the vehicle and often making long
burns on the main engine, twice coming within a hundred meters of an
asteroid, pivoting the nimble little ship around between burns to
dodge first this asteroid then another as they came into her radar's
field of vision.  She began a series of slowdown burns about ten
minutes from the construction asteroid, finally docking with the other
OTV only an hour and three minutes after the accident.

"Can we go back the normal way?" Vic asked dryly as they unstrapped
from their seats.  The doctor's fingers were white from where they had
been grasping the seat.

The NASA engineer's fancy flying had probably saved Alister's life.
After stabilizing his condition, Vic declared there was no rush to get
him back to the _Icarus_, since he had brought all the medical
supplies he needed with him.  Andrea and Burns tried to complete the
assembly work, but found that one of the two damaged modules was
simply incapable of holding pressure in its plumbing, so they took
both with them and piloted the two OTVs back to _Icarus_ - the normal
way.  At a crew meeting two days later, held around Alister's sick bed
with his arm in a cast, Andrea was unanimously selected first officer.


T + 520 days

Due to the considerable radio time lag at this point, the media
couldn't interview Andrea except through videomail, which meant
that a lot of her answers took the form of monologues.  One
thing was for sure.  The woman who had saved Alister's life
and been promoted to first officer had started to generate
a lot of media interest.

"Captain Mercurio says the problem is democracy, that it's another
communism.  Do you agree?"

The NASA engineer thought for a moment before answering.

"The problem is human nature.  Democracy is just another political
system.  In some ways it's better than others, in some ways worse.
Ultimately, the solutions to our problems are spiritual and not
political.  Unfortunately, democracy tends to accentuate a lot of
problems, because you can't just go blame it off on some dictator."

"How does democracy accentuate problems?"

"Well, the problems have always been there.  It's just that democracy
shows us that a lot of our problems are still with us; that it's not
just because people don't have political representation that causes
our problems.  Now people do have political representation, and a lot
of the problems are still with us.  So, just giving political power to
the people doesn't solve your problems."

The commentator cut it.  "Dr. Yeats, you mentioned a moment ago
that democracy is better than some political systems, worse than
others, or something to that effect.  If I'm not reading too
much into your words, can you give us an example of a superior
political system?"

"Well, I don't know if there are any superior political systems.
Like I said, our problems are spiritual more than political,
and thus we need spiritual solutions more so than political ones.
Now take a monarch like King Arthur; you can have a good king,
genuinely interested in caring for his people, and yes, you
can have a good monarchy."

"Do you advocate monarchy as a system of government?"

"I don't advocate anything as a system of government.  I advocate
Christianity as a means for people to live their lives.  Monarchy is
like any other system of government, you might get a good king for a
while, but eventually you'll get a bad one, so it's no answer.
There's the story in the Bible of the Jewish people demanding a king -
this was Saul - and the prophet at the time, I believe it was Samuel,
told them that the king would take the best of their crops, and
conscript their sons into his army, and tax their profits, but the
people wanted a king anyway.  And some of the Jewish kings were pretty
lousy men."

"So, doctor, I'm, I'm not sure exactly what you mean when you say
that you advocate Christianity rather than any system of government.
For example, what do you say to Captain Mercurio's very vocal
criticisms of western society?"

"Well, I'm still on his crew, so I'd better not say too much!"

Due to the time lag in the transmission, it was almost a second
before anybody laughed, so the joke fell flat.  She faltered
a moment, then continued.

"No, seriously, he makes a lot of good points, but this has been human
society since the dawn of time.  Take Saint Anthony of the Desert, for
example.  God appeared to him in a vision and told him to flee from
men, so he went to live in the desert, and founded the Christian
monastic tradition.  This was during the Roman Empire, when Christians
were thrown to the lions, so these problems have been around for a
while."

"Haven't we come a long ways from that?  We don't throw Christians to
the lions anymore."

"No, we don't, thank God, but it's still tough to live as Christians.
Generally, the people who rise to the top in human society do so
by abandoning Christian values, so living as a Christian generally
means that you're going to get a lot of doors slammed shut on you."

"Could you elaborate on that?  How do people not live as Christians?"

"Oh, please, look around.  Christ gave us two great commandments,
to love God with all our hearts, and to love our neighbors as
ourselves.  And he elaborated on them, and lived them in his own
life.  I think the second commandment is more obvious than the
first; we look around and see how we don't love each other as
Christ taught, that's more obvious that how we fail God."

"Could you be more specific; I'm not trying to be dense, but
why don't you think a Christian can rise to the top in our society?"

"Well, consider what Christ said.  He taught us to give to all those
who beg from us; that if someone asked to borrow from us we should
give without expecting anything in return.  If you do that, if you
give to all, you often end up with nothing, at least nothing
material."

"So do you advocate a welfare system of some kind?"

"Well, no, not if I understand your question, because welfare to me
implies some kind of government operation.  Christ didn't tell us to
give our money to the government to run welfare, he didn't tell us to
give our money to the church so it could fund charities, he told us,
he spoke to us as individuals, he said _you_, give to all those who
beg of _you_.  So, if you see someone standing by the road begging,
you stop and give them a dollar or two, if you see someone asking for
a ride, you pull over and ask them where they're going, if you see
someone sleeping in a park, you say 'hey, I've got a spare room, you
can come stay with me', or whatever.  And people don't want to do
that.  If they see a beggar, they keep driving, they choose leaders
that always tell us not to pick up hitchhikers, the guy in the park,
well, that's what the homeless shelter is for."

"But isn't it dangerous to pick up hitchhikers?"

"Sure, but it's more dangerous not to pick them up.  It's dangerous
because then we're violating the commandments that Christ gave us to
live by; we're acting out of fear and not love.  And the reason
someone, well a lot of people, actually, like Captain Mercurio, really
dislike democracy is because people don't choose leaders who say,
look, you should stop and pick these people up, they choose leaders
who say, no, don't do that, think of how dangerous it is, put your own
safety first."

"You mentioned homeless shelters, in a somewhat negative way.  Do you
not support homeless shelters?"

"Well, I've been a few, many years ago, before I had a steady job
with NASA.  The problem with homeless shelters is that people think
because there's a homeless shelter, well, the problem's taken care
of, they don't have to do anything, but again, Christ tells us that
we should..."

"But can't people take advantage of that?  I mean, won't some people
just take and take and take without working or really doing anything
productive?"

"Sure, a lot of people will, in a lot of different ways.  Christianity
is about being taken advantage of, when you love unconditionally, when
you give unconditionally, when you forgive unconditionally, people
will just take and take and take, and most people, understandably,
don't want that, and that's why they really don't live as Christians.
They give up to a point and then they say no more.  But one of
Christ's stories was about a woman who came to the temple in Jerusalem
to give a donation.  There were all these other people who gave all
these big donations, and this old woman gave just two bits.  Jesus
told his diciples that she went away redeemed rather than the others,
because she had given all she had, while the others had just given
their surplus.  So it's not about how much you give, it's about you're
willingness to give all."

"Well, that raises a good point, that's been made by people like
Warren Buffett.  I mean, can't you do a lot more good in the world by
working hard, so then you'll have the money to spend on charities that
can really make a difference?"

"Well, now we come back to the first commandment, the one about loving
God.  The point isn't to do as much good as we can in the world, the
point is to live in harmony with God.  That's really what's going on
here, ultimately we're all spiritual beings, first and foremost, so
how much good we can do in the world is really secondary if we're not
living in harmony with God, so that's why the woman who just gives a
little goes away redeemed, because she's the one who's living in
harmony with God."

"What does it mean to live in harmony with God, how do we do that?"

"That's what Christ taught us.  That's what his Gospel teachings are
all about.  I mean, Christ could have chosen to be a political leader,
he was tempted to do that by the Devil, he could have liberated the
Jewish people from the Roman Empire, heck, he could have become the
Roman Emperor, he could have freed the slaves two thousand years ago,
he could have done a lot more 'good' in the world if he'd been
tougher.  But what he was trying to teach us is that living in harmony
with God, loving God, loving each other as sons and daughters of God,
is more important that all the 'good' you do."

"I don't think I understand, completely.  Isn't the 'good' we do, I
mean, isn't that what living in harmony with God is about?"

"No, not really, it's just an effect.  Christ taught us that faith in
God is the most important thing, and that our works come from our
faith.  Our good deads, our works, they are the outward expression of
our inward faith, but it's the faith that's the most important thing.
So you can do all kind of good works, but if the faith isn't there, it
doesn't amount for much.  On the other hand, if you have faith, then
it will be expressed in your works, because you'll always be looking
for ways to help people, to give to people, to forgive people, because
you love people, or at least try to.  I guess it's kinda like what
Marc, what Captain Mercurio did to defraud his investors, he created
some kind of robot that could cook dinner, but it didn't work the way
he said, because it actually had a person operating it.  Good works
are like that, it's not the outward appearance that's important, it's
what's going on behind the scenes."

"OK, we've only got a few minutes left, let me change the subject, at
least slightly.  You're a scientist, or at least an engineer, so what
do you say to people who claim that there's no scientific proof from
the existance of God, so it must be just a myth?"

"You know, I was asked that question many years ago, and at the time I
couldn't really answer it, but I thought about for a while and here's
my answer: Scientific proof is based on experiment.  There is an
experiment you can perform to find out if God is real - you can die.
Most of us don't want to perform that experiment just to satisfy our
curiosity about God, but the fact remains that we will all die some
day, and then you'll know.  So my answer to those people is just to
wait - you're going to find out all about God."

"Well, thank you for joining us this evening.  My guest had been
Dr. Andrea Yeats, astronaut and Christian.  We'll be back in a minute
with my final thought."

The entire crew had watched the broadcast, floating on the other
side of the TV camera.  After the program ended, they were
fairly quite for a while, the captain in particular.

"You did really good, I was quite proud of you," was all he had to say.



Meanwhile, Burns had devised a scheme to spray a insulation
compound derived from carbon that stuck to all the asteroids
they tested it on, and left a layer of insulation that withstood
high temperatures.  He devised a way to spray and insulate
the bottom of the 747.

---- They make it first to the astroid belt, where they outfit the
ship with everything missing.  They build a giant carbon sprayer
and in this way fix the two modules that still have meteor strikes
that can't be sealed.  They sprayed the bottom of an old 747
NASA had given them and began to wonder it to would work as a
landing craft.

	     CHAPTER CHAPTER CHAPTER

They had made it back to Earth without incident.  Crouds, cheering,
parties, Andrea vaquely remembered them.  She had settled back into
life as a NASA engineer, and after the initial round of publicity
wore off, back into some kind of routine.  The chance to go to Tokyo
for a conference came up, and she jumped at it.  She was the keynote
speaker, all the media wanted to interview her, and best of all a lot
of people just didn't recognize her as she walked around downtown.
Those who did were invariably polite.  She came back to her hotel
after a wonderful sushi dinner, and was gazing out from her window
at the city below.  Then the door was thrown open, she turned around,
and gasped in fear.

"Think I'd forgotten about you?"  He stood silohited in the lighted
frame of the door as he walked into the dark room.  Her heart leaped
with fear and her feet were frozen to the ground.  She couldn't
move; couldn't scream... but yelled as she woke up.

T + 624 days

"Look we've made it this far without any serious problems."

"Yeah, but all the really critical stuff's been well tested up until
now.  Think about it.  We test-fired all the rocket engines before
using any of them.  We burned extra fuel to keep the aerodynamic
stresses on the 747 within its normal flight tolerances.  We
brought spare fuel canisters in case the supply tanks didn't
work."

"And we didn't really need any of those things.  Look, the
bottom line is that we said we were going to Mars, and now
we're here and we have to land."

"Why do you have to land?"  Andrea interjected.  The NASA engineer
had floated into the room unnoticed during their debate.  "Why can't
you just go back to Earth?  You've already accomplished more than
almost any other space mission.  This will go down along with
with Gagarin's flight and Armstrong's moon landing..."

"We have to land!" the captain shouted.  Alister and Vic stopped work
two modules away and moved closer to try to overhear more of the
conversation.

"If we don't land," he continued, "they'll say we failed, and then the
capitalists will just come back two years from now and make the first
landing on Mars; heck, they'll probably use our technology to do it."

"So let them!" Andrea shot back, drawing only a snort in reply.  "Why
do you have to risk everything just to win your private little war?"

"Well, maybe you find this hard to understand from your cushy NASA
perch," Marcellus continued, his voice dripping with sarcasm, "but
there's a lot of people back home rooting for us to show the world
that you don't have to become one of these ruthless bums to get
something done in life."

"Don't you?  Haven't you?" she challenged him.  "How many millions did
_you_ steal, captain?  How many toes did you step on?  Don't tell me
you haven't become ruthless!"

"We are landing this plane on Mars," Mercurio stated slowly and
firmly, in a no-nonsense command tone of voice.  "That has been
the goal of this mission from day one.  We take the risks as they
come, but we have a mission plan and we're going to carry it out."

"OK, if we're going to do that..." Burns started, then stopped as
Andrea flung herself through the hatchway, muttering something
about "just like NASA" as she zoomed away through the spacecraft.

"If we're going to do that," Burns continued, "I want to make at least
one test pass where we just reenter through the atmosphere, fly down
there without landing and come back up.  That way, we can take some
low-level photographs of the landing area to make sure there aren't
any nasty surprises waiting for us.  We might even want to survey
several landing areas before we pick one.  We've got plenty of fuel
now."

"Sounds good.  Let's start getting ready."


T + 650 days

The bottom line was that any reentry attempt, even without a landing,
required flying the 747 in atmospheric flight.  Only Burns had ever
flown a 747.  Furthermore, the thin Martian air required a much higher
airspeed and possibly presented handling challenges to the pilot.
Only Burns, it seemed, could make a reentry attempt, and after the
incident in the asteroid belt, the Captain decided against sending
Alister with him.  Finally, it was decided that he would pilot the
aircraft alone.

Disaster on Mars.  Burns attempts to land the 747, but they hadn't
gotten everything figured quite right.  The wings snap off during
reentry and the whole thing goes up in a fireball.  Burns dies.

The wings of the aircraft had been designed to flex, yet the carbon
coating was rigid.  Burns and Alister had correctly calculated the
aerodynamic forces from the reentry, and the dense layer of carbon
was strong enough to withstand those forces, yet hairline cracks
began to creep into the carbon during reentry.

Burns' first warning was a loud crack that sounded like a firecracker
or gunshot.

"What was that?" he wondered aloud.

The answer came less than a second later, as the left wing tore away
from the fuselage and slammed into the tail before falling away
towards the red planet below.  Liquid hydrogen gushed from the jagged
hole in the plane's left side as it swerved into an uncontrollable
spin.  The right wing crumbled under the new stresses, but before much
more could happen one of the remaining engines ignited the leaking
hydrogen and the entire aircraft disappeared into a ball of flame.

In orbit, the Icarus crew were first stunned by the sudden loss of
telemetry, then watched speechless as the aircraft flamed red on black
against the planet surface below, then disintegrated into hundreds of
tiny meteors that streaked silently into the Martian dawn.

T + 651 days

"Disaster on Mars" scream the newspapers.

Most world goverments issue a Statement of Condolence.  The United
States is critized in Europe for the lukewarm nature of its official
comment.

A tense but unharmed crew holds a staff meeting.  The Captain is silent.

"OK, we should assemble the cargo modules into a chain, and get ready
to go home," Vic began.

"We can't assemble the cargo modules without the 747," Alister interjected.
"At least, we can't yet.  I need to run some simulations.  We've got
the cargo modules from the asteroid belt that we rigged to push things
around, but I've got to figure how to get them... lined up in a row."

"Well, how do we do that."

"I don't know."

"What do you mean, what's the first thing to do?"

"I don't know.  I guess, I guess I've got to think about it for a while."

The room fell silent.

"Can you do it?" Brian asked quietly.

"Do what?  Put the things in a row?  I think so."

"Can you get us home?"

Again the room was quiet.  Everyone except the Captain and Dr. Yeats
were looking at Alister.  Finally Alister blurted out.

"I don't know."

The NASA engineer looked up.  She had been thinking carefully about
what she wanted to say.  "Alister's not alone.  I've got more hours of
spaceflight logged than anyone else here."

Vic furrowed his eyebrows.  It was the first time he had thought about
it, but Dr. Andrea Yeats would for many years hold the record for most
lifetime hours of spaceflight.  She was going on.

"And we've got this whole crew.  Alister's the chief engineer now, so
if says he needs time to think about it and simulate it, fine.  He'll
need help.  I can make myself do equations again.  I volunteer as
assistant engineer."

Bryan said, "We need you as first officer."

Vic volunteers as assistant engineer, is accepted in lue of Dr. Yeats,
and the meeting adjours.


T + 652 days

The Captain stops coming to staff meetings.

Alister's face is plastered on the Earth tabloids.  "Can the kid get
them home?" one asks.  Another focused on lurid details, supplied
by a panel of experts, on what Burns' last moments must have been
like.  U.S. rags like to publish how Edgar Cayce's prophesies had
fortold the disaster.

Dr. Yeats took to organizing Burns' library, made sure Alister had
everything he asked for, suggested some books he hadn't thought about,
and reading a bit herself.


T + 658 days

Alister begins maneuvering the cargo modules.  He can get them home,
but the trip's going to take a lot longer than anyone had planned on.

Without the 747,  all they could do was line up all the modules
in more or a less a row, with one rocket engine in the very rear,
and spend days under light thrust to make a burn.


T + 690 days

The captain drifted into the compartment and the conversation stopped.

"Need anything, sir?" Bryan asked.

"No, I'm just going to the infirmatory for an ibuprofin."  He drifted
across and out through the hatch.  Andrea pulled out of the footholds
and followed him.  He was going through the tablets as she entered
the infirmatory, and hardly looked up to see who it was.

"So what are you thinking?" she said after a moment.

He answered with a snort.  "You don't want to know what I'm thinking."

"Yes, I do."  He looked up at her.  "I really want to know what you're
thinking."

He looked back down at the capsules in his hand, dry swallowed two and
shoved the rest back into the container.  Then he floated still and
was silent for a while before answering.

"I knew this thing was dangerous.  I guess I just always figured if
somebody was going to die, it was going to be me, so... so what,
right?  I didn't think it would be my best friend."

"We all knew it was dangerous..." she started to answer.

"No.  You were right.  I've cut so many corners on this thing, this
mission, I might as well have reached out and killed them myself.
I... I just don't...  I just should never have come."

Andrea lowered her voice, moved closer, and took Marcelius Mercurio by
the arm.

"Look, let me tell you something I've never really told anyone.  I've
been on three space shuttle launches, and watched a dozen more from
Mission Control.  And every time, I mean _every_time_ they say those
words 'Go at throttle up'..."  Her voice drifted off and she choked
back tears.

"You know why Challenger blew up?  The engineers knew it was too cold
to launch.  But Ronald Reagan was giving a speech, and he wanted his
teacher in space, and the mission managers thought, well, maybe we
can let it slid a bit this time, no big deal."

"Everyone cuts corners," she continued.  "People cut corners driving
their cars - 'oh, I didn't have that much to drink, I'll be OK to drive' -
people cut corners at work - 'it'll be OK, we need to get it out
by the deadline' - people cut corners at home - 'Johny'll have another
ball game next week, I'll make that one'.  People cut corners all the
time - it's a fact of life," she emphasized as he shook his head and
pulled away.

"Not when people's lives are at stake," he answered.

"You're a perfectionist," she stated in a matter-of-fact tone.

"You're damn right I'm a perfectionist," he shot back.

"And they died because you weren't perfect.  Your plan wasn't perfect,
your software wasn't perfect, and you weren't perfect."  He looked her
right in the eye.  "But I knew your plan wasn't perfect, and I came
anyway.  And they knew it wasn't perfect, and they still followed
you."  Now he looked down and away.  "And I know _you_'re not
perfect... but I still love you."

Mercurio didn't say anything in response, nor did he look up.  Andrea
waited a moment longer, then returned to the smokers in the com shack.

"I can't beleive I just said that," she mumbled to herself.

"Said what?" Alister asked.

"Look, I guess you can forgive me... I just don't know if I can forgive
myself.  I mean..." his voice drifted off.

"It's over.  It may take you a long time to forgive yourself; heck,
you may _never_ forgive yourself, but it's over.  You made a mistake,
now it's time to go on, because there's no other place to go."

He nodded and said "OK", but wasn't really sure himself if he could do it.

Mercurio pulled himself into the com shack a bit faster and bit more
focused than he'd done in weeks.  "Alister?"

"Sir?" the younger looked up from his computer game.

"Plot a trajectory for Earth.  We break orbit in three days."

"You give to others because that's how we were taught to live by Jesus."

Vic spoke first.  "What if you don't necessarily beleive in Jesus?"

"Well, I guess people used to believe the Earth is flat.  You can
beleive whatever you want; the fact is that the Earth is round.  And
I'm absolutely convinced that Jesus of Nazarath was the most
spiritually advanced being to ever live on Earth.  So we should take
his teachings seriously."

With cork puller still attached, the cork went flying unheaded across
the cabin as the Captain grabed for the plastic cover and slapped it over
the top of the wine bottle.  Even so, several gobs of the red alcohol
went floating into the air, the liquid's surface tension forming them
into perfectly round spheres.  Andrea shook her head.

"You'd think that after two and a half years in space, you'd have learned
how to open a wine bottle without spilling it everywhere."

"What I've learned," the Captain answered, as he spun across the
compartment and swallowed one of the larger floating drops, "is that
if you spill red wine in space, it's a lot easier to clean up than on
Earth!"

Mercurio spilt only a few more drops as he "poured" the wine into two
wine glasses, each one quickly covered with a flat plastic square.
Drinking from straws was much easier, but Marc had dug into the ship's
stores an hour earlier, produced the glasses alongside the bottle, and
Andrea had stood on tradition.

"Cheers."

They clinked glasses and laughed together as the Captain spilled wine
all over his face as he tried to drink it.  Andrea grabbed a towel and
started to wipe off his face.

"You guys better come in here!" Alister yelled, then got up and
propelled himself through the hatchway.

"Well, m-maybe you want to come in here," he stammered as he realized
that he was interrupting a "private" dinner.

"What's up?" the Captain asked.

"Somebody just smashed a plane into the World Trade Center!"

At 1431 GMT, September 11, 2001, after first the event on Earth and
then a radio transmission lag of exactly 3 minutes 17 seconds, the
silent crew watched the second tower collapse.  In the days ahead, it
would be revealed that Islamic terrorists had hijacked four American
airlines.  Coincidently, or perhaps not, all were Boings.  Two had
slammed, full throttle, into the twin towers of World Trade Center, at
one time the tallest building in the world, and headquarters to dozens
of major companies.  Burns would have suggested imagining the pictures
you've seen of jet crash scenes, then trying to project it 100 stories
above you onto a skyscraper in lower Manhattan.  Within hours, the
buildings fell.  Bankers, mail men, fire fighters, bus boys - all lost
their lives that terrible morning.

Within days, the nation mobilized.  Medical teams sprung into action,
fire fighters dove into the wreckage alongside men who walked up on
the street and volunteered, desperate to find anything still alive in
the tons of rubble.  At Andrea's suggestion, The Captain issued a
statement of condolence, expressing his "deapest reget", and stating
that it grieved him as nearly as much the death of his "dear friend
Burns".  The entire crew followed suit.  Asked via videomail by the
press about his comparison with Burns, he replied that though he
deeply felt the loss in New York, he was sure the family's victims
would concer that no one feels a loss more acutely than that of a
loved one.  The media largely accepted this.

Within weeks, President Bush attacked Afghanistan after correctly
finguring Osama bin Ladin as the culprit.  The Captain began objecting
to Bush's behavior, stating publically than an orderly extradition
procedure should be followed rather than an invasion.  Andrea Yeats
said that all parties should try to resolve their problems peacefully,
though she ruefully noted that the Muslems would do good to accept
Christ, and ruffled feathers by suggesting that the terrorists,
misguided though they may have been, were probably the only people
that morning who got on the airplanes because they were trying to do
God's will.

Within months, most of the old animosities had resurfaced.  The
Captain was still openly critical of the western democratic
establishment in general, and the Bush Administration in particular.
Dr. Yeats became far more prominent, and far more controversial, by
her repeated advice to end the war, moarn over the dead, then ask
ourselves why so many people hated the country and decide to give our
lives over to God to do something about it.

Within a year, it had become obvious to many people that the September
11th attack was not simply an outrageous act of terrorism, but in fact
a devastatingly effective act of unconventional warfare.
Osama bin Ladin wasn't a mad terrorist out to kill as many
people as he could.  He was a genius stratagition, who knew
he'd get one shot at his brillent plan, and was determined
to make it work by striking the hardest blow he could muster
at his arch-enemy's political and financial infrastructure.
While the
political prong of the twin assult had failed, the economic prong had
succeeded beyond belief.
Considering not only the twin towers
of the World Trade Center, but the smaller buildings destroyed,
or ravaged with all their windows blown out, plus the entire
multi-block area that had been shut down for months, the center
of New York's city's financial district had been devastated.

Economies are complex systems, where events
trigger other events, coast for a time, reflect from boundaries, then
interact again, much like ripples on a pond, or perhaps a pile of
leaves in the wind.  Mathemticins, economists, and mathematically
inclined economists study the statistical response of economies, but
the impulse functions of such entities are not completely understood.
The intricate network of buyers, sellers, consumers, suppliers,
distributors, bankers, salesman, real estate agents, and thousands of
other occupations that form The Economy, that much-worshiped god of
business plans, spreadsheets, balance sheets and profit-and-loss
statements that the Captain would have called the Global Capitalist
Economic System, had been dealt a crippling blow.  The stock market
was down.  And it stayed down.  As the analysts puzzled over corporate
earnings ratios, and how many bargins were popping up on the market
these days, and how a bottoming out had to occur soon, amid patriotic
demonstrations of pride and determination, an almost insane euphoria
that the terrorists would only "win" if we let them, and coming on the
heels of a burst speculative bubble the year before, day after day,
week and week, month after month, the market kept going down, down,
and down.  As the Dow Jones Industrial Average, that bellweather of
American business performance, once pegged spectacuarly above 10,000,
now dipped below 1000, and as the men and women of the U.S began to
realize, in the inmortal words of John Kenneth Galbriegth describing a
similar collapse many years ago, "there was no limit to how far down
the market could go", the _Icarus_ came home.  the gravity of their
situation.
Into this environment, the _Icarus_ came home.

By the time the _Icarus_ was close enough to Earth orbit that the
videomail was no longer needed, the U.S. was looking for heros, and
for the men and women of the disastrously successful space mission,
their hour had come.  Practically the entire anti-government movement
finally dropped all their quibbles and lined up behind Marceleus
Mercurio, ready to declare peace or war at his whim.  Some ministers
and many religious people believed Andrea Yeats was a genuine
spiritual leader.  Others added up the letters of her name in Chinese
to obtain 666.  Alister Compton was declared the world's sexiest
astronaut by a popular poll.  Vic spent hours on end holed up, working
on a proposal to reform medical care that the AMA had invited him to
make, and Bryan and his men were informally told that all charges
against them would be dropped if they'd sign up as the U.S's first
squad of Space Rangers.  Several proposals were floated for a memorial
to Burns.

President Bush told Mercurio that his was willing to send the space
shuttle to retrieve them, but that he and his men would be arrested
upon return to Earth and charged with crimes against them.  He hinted
that they would probably be released on their own recognizance, but
the Captain would hear none of it.  As the media began to speculate
about what kind of legal reception awaited the crew, the Captain
agreed to the shuttle proposal, primarily because he had no other way
to return to Earth from orbit.

After the first burn to put them back onto a course for Earth,
a very late burn, just short of Earth orbit, was required to correct
their final approach vector and insert them into a high parking
orbit from where their could kill their momemtum and drop down
into a circular orbit from where the OTVs could take them down
to a newly built space station (the International Space Station).
Alister had carefully calculated this correctional burn.  It would
take several hours, and be a retrograd burn - they should have turned
the ship around to make the burn.  But the Captain, realizing that
this would be great trouble, elected to move one of the OTVs to
the other side of the long cargo chain and push from there,
applying thrust to the craft in the opposite direction from
that of either the 747 or the engine configuration they had
used to leave Martian orbit.

Twenty five minutes into the burn, the engines died out, and
fuel alarms began going off all over the ship.  In retrospect
the problem was obvious, since the ship's design had used the force
of the thrust to push the fuel to the back of the ship where
large tanks kept the fuel supply pressurized and distributed
it throughout the ship, including to the engine of the OTV
on the far side of the chain, since its onboard supply of fuel
wasn't sufficient to maintain the long burn for a sufficient
duration.  Burns would have anticipated it.  Alister did not.

In fact, all the fuel had passed to the front of the ship's tanks
within minutes of beginning the burn, and only the fuel supply in the
OTV had kept the burn going almost half an hour, as well as keeping
the entire fuel system pressurized.  Alister had in fact noticed the
pressure drop right when the burn started, and told the Captain about
it, but it stabilized at an acceptable level and they continued
the burn.  Now all the fuel had been exhausted from the OTV's tank,
all the fuel in the main tanks was all the way forward, away from
the pressure cylinders and other apparatus in the rear of the craft.
The only remaining fuel immediately at the disposal of the crew
was in small presurized cylinders that acted as pressure equalizers
between each module's fuel cell and the main fuel lines.  They had
stop values that kept their pressurized contents from escaping
back into the purged main line system.  It took the crew about ten
minutes to determine that all their fuel and power would be gone
in about two hours.

"So we'd better shut everything off that we don't absolutely need,"
the Captain concluded.

Alister could close all the values from his computer, so they quickly
tried to decide what they needed and what they didn't.  The
greenhouses came up immediately.  They were the single biggest power
consumer on the ship.  Some of their lights were off, but for the
others an important decision had to be made.

"It might not affect them that much if they were only off for one
light cycle," Vic noted.

"And we've got plenty of food stored up - enough to get us back to
Earth," Andrea noted.

"OK, turn them off," Mercurio ordered.  "Then let's figure out what
we're going to do next."

Figuring that out became quite problamatic.

The ship was considerably less than a light-minute from Earth, so the
latest development was flashed quickly all over the world.
Comparisons began with Apollo 13, the flawed NASA lunar mission that
lost its power halfway to the Moon after an oxygen tank explosion
crippled part of the ship.  Experts said the situation was both less
serious, since there was no explosion or damage to the ship, and more
serious, since the ship was in interplanetary orbit and couldn't just
coast back to Earth without its engines.  The National Enquirer
published a cover story suggesting that some of Nostradomes's
quatrains refered to the _Icarus_, that the death of their brilliant
chief engineer was only the first of many woes to befall the crew, and
that none of them would make it back to Earth alive.

With the exception of Vic and Bryan, the entire crew had been awake
now for twenty four hours.  Every scheme they came up with had flaws.
The reserve fuel had been pumped out of the other OTVs as standard
procedure while they were docked.  The plan was to fuel them before
using them, as Andrea had done prior to launch into the asteroid belt
to save Alister, so their engines were useless.  Using all their fuel
canisters from the various modules, they could pressurize the fuel
system briefly, but at no where near the pressure needed to ignite any
of the thrusters.  Reconnecting the OTV on the far end of the array
directly to the fuel lines, instead of running the fuel down the ship
and pumping it back up, would have worked while the OTV had reserve
fuel, but again, there was no way to apply sufficient fuel pressure to
ignite the engine and begin the burn.  Even siphoning fuel off from
the tanks was nearly imposible, since their main fuel lines were mated
with the rest of the module they were attached to, and thus there was
no way to open the fuel line without undocking the modules, which they
had no fuel to do.  Shunting the fuel from one line to another
permited some to be drawn off into hand held pressure cylinders, but
again at nowhere near the pressure needed to ignite any of the
engines.  It now was becoming apparent that while they could stretch
their available fuel about two weeks, they were going to have serious
problems restarting any of the rocket engines, and therefore couldn't
move the fuel to the rear of the ship where it could easily be drawn
off.


T + 752 days

Alister and Andrea come up with a scheme to divert the gaseous
atmosphere into the fuel lines and shoot spurts of air out of the
various manuefering thrusters.  It would allow them to undock
at least the rear OTV and move around the ship.  Undocking
any significant number of cargo modules was problamatic.  NASA,
by now eager to advise, had almost immediately set its team of
engineers to pour over the problem.  They devised a radical solution.

By expending a lot of their available atmosophere in the OTV,
they could give the entire ship a slight forward nudge.  NASA
had simulated the motion of the fuel in the tanking system
and concluded that a sufficient quantity of fuel to fire the
engines could be reliably be moved through a single tank -
not the 28 it would take to move any of the fuel all the way
back to the pressure tanks in the rear of the craft.  This
idea proved the basis for a desperate gamble.

They would move the entire ship to undock the farthest fuel module,
docked to the OTV, and expend all of the OTV's atmosphere to propel
the fuel back into the OTV's tanks.  If it didn't work, whoever were
the astronauts on the OTV would be effectively gone, floating away
from the ship in a powerless, airless OTV with only their spacesuit
power.  Some thought was given to running the OTV remotely.  While
possible, it would also require the complex return manuefuer to be
done remotely, because the ship would still be dead in space and the
OTV would need to put it underway again.  Doing this remotely was
undesirable.

The Captain was now faced with a crucial decision.  Should he send a
competent OTV party, and risk seperating the crew?  Should he have
everyone go on the OTV, and risk seperation from the cargo modules and
any hope of return to Earth without them?  Should he pilot the OTV
remotely, and risk that some simple malfunction could kill them?

Alister hadn't slept in almost three days.  The Captain ordered him to
take eight hours off, spend it smoking dope, or listening to CDs, or
whatever.  The young engineer started to object, but Vic seconded the
order as a medical directive.  The power was turned back on in his
module, and he smoked the last joint Burns had given him, that they
were going to smoke when he got back from Mars.  Ten minutes later, he
was fast asleep.

Andrea was already going over the burn calculations again when
Alister awoke.  He groaned when he saw the printouts taped
to the walls, the floating physics texts, and the complex
computer systems, running on mimimum power.

"Don't look," Andrea said.  "If you don't want to look, don't
look.  I want you to be fresh and go over this top to bottom
before we try it, but you can take another day off if you
don't want to look at it now."

That was exactly what they did.  Andrea looked over the plan that day,
as did teams of NASA, ESA, and RSA engineers and amateur enthusiasts
everywhere.

T + 754 days

The Captain decided to send both Andrea and Alister,
told them that if it didn't work he was depending on them to find
someway to get the fuel into the OTV.  They would detach from the rear
of the ship in the main OTV, use its atmosphere to manuefuer away from
the ship.  Then the Captain would blow about half the air in the
greenhouses to undock the ship from the last fuel module.  Then Andrea
and Alister would have to move their OTV to the fuel module, while the
rest of the ship moved away from them, dock to it, and use the rest of
their atmosphere to push forward on the fuel module.  Three hours
later, a quanity of fuel should have passed into the OTV's fuel tank,
at which point they would close the values and presurize the fuel
tank.  Pressurize with what?  They would need the atmosphere both to
move the ship and to pressurize the fuel.  In fact, they would need
about half their available atmosphere to pressure the fuel tank up to
operating pressure.  They would also need a working fuel cell to run
the pump, so they need some of the near-empty fuel and oxyidizer
canisters.

T + 755 days

They try it and it works.  Alister refuels  the OTV from the tank
and returns to Icarus, where they repressurize their fuel system
and get the ship running again.  By now they are so close
to Earth orbit that they decide to go for a slingshot by
the planet, followed by orbital interface.

Lou thumbed some papers on his desk and beat around the bush for
a minute.  He didn't quite know how to ask what he wanted to ask,
so finally he just blurt it out.

"I'm looking for a volunteer flight crew to pick up the Icarus crew
and land the shuttle in Europe or somewhere."

The shuttle pilot and commander looked at each other, then back at the
STS program coordinator.  "This isn't approved by the director, is it
sir?"

"No."  Lou paused before continuing.  "You can say I gave you the
order to do..."

The commander interjected.  "You can't give us that kind of order,
sir.  We'd be court-martialed and thrown out of the space program,
probably the entire military."

An awkward silence fell over the room.  Breaking it, the pilot asked,
"Is this a favor for Andrea?"

Lou rubbed his hand over his balding scalp, noting the sweatiness of
both his head and his hands, and nodded in response, "Yeah".

"I'm in," he said, looking over at the shuttle commander.  Lou looked
up with surprise.  He had imagined this interview going much
differently.  Suddenly, he suddenly found himself outnumbering the Air
Force colonel, who looked back and forth between the administrator and
pilot before finally collapsing.

"Ah, what the hell.  I'm sick of this gig, anyway.  Mission
specialists have all the fun; all I do is command the thing!"


T + 803 days

"What's the chance of them hijacking the shuttle, or something?"

The NASA chief looked at his two subordinates, who both answered
simultaneously.

"No, I don't think..."  "I think that's a definite..."

Becker continued first.

"It's a definite concern.  These guys aren't some bunch of space
tourists.  They know how to operate a spaceship, and their track
record shows the kind of things they're willing to do to get what they
want."

Vic spoke up next.

"I've known Andrea Yeats for almost 15 years, and there's no way she
would be involved with any kind of hijacking or anything of the kind.
No way."

"What if she isn't involved?  What if Mercurio and his crew just hijack
the thing without telling her anything?"

Vic shook his head.

"I don't think so.  She's part of that crew now.  After three years,
I don't think they'd make any major decision without involving her."

The director looked back at the two men standing across the desk from
him.  He took off his glasses and tossed them down on the desk.

"Well, the president said to bring them back, so bring them back.  I
just hope we get the damn shuttle down in one piece."


T + 807 days

"Five."

"Four."

"Three."

"Two."

"One."

Alister's voice clipped off the final seconds, then the computer
began the insertion burn.  The slight force from the engine
pushed the crew gently backwards into their seats.  The
computer screen next to the engineer showed their current
tragectory, in blue, an open hyperbola that skittered out
off the screen, and their target tragectory, a neat red
circle centered on a green disk that represented Earth.
As the engines fired, the blue line began curving more
strongly back towards the direction they were coming from,
as another clock ticked down more seconds.

"Orbital interface in five, four, three, two, one, Earth orbit."

The blue line flicked neatly into a broad ellipse.  Alister breathed a
sigh of relief.  Almost nothing, short of something absurdly
catostraphic, like crashing into the atmosphere, could stop them from
getting back to Earth now.  Even the engine failed now, they would be
in some crazy orbit that the OTV's could get them down from no matter
what.

"ECO in five; four; three; two; one; Engine Cutout"

The thrust stopped, just as the blue and red lines had merged into a
single yellow circle.  They were siting in a circular, six-hour
parking orbit.

"Perfect burn," Alister declared, as he broke out into a wide
grin and let out a whoop.

In the next few days, the crew moved all their personal
belongings, along with anything they wanted to return with,
including gold from the asteroid belt, into OTV 2, secured everything
else they were leaving on the ship, and finally all piled into
the OTV and slipped away from the ship.  Firing the OTV's one
rocket, they dropped towards a rendevous with the partially
completed International Space Station.


T + 811 days

"So, what's the plan?" Mercurio asked the shuttle commander and pilot.

"Basically, everything's fine until we deorbit about six hours before
we're supposed to, ignore mission control when they start hollering,
drop into the atmosphere off the Atlantic coast of Africa, contact
Dakar approach on the radio, declare an emergency, and land."

"Dakar?  Senegal?"

"Yep.  Supposed to have nice beaches.  We're gonna find out."

"And what happens to you guys?"

The two officers looked at each other before the pilot answered.

"We'll probably be court-martialed and run out of the space program;
I doubt we'll get any jail time, probably just dishonorable discharges."

The commander spoke up as he pulled the checklist back down in front
of him.

"I'm sick of flying these buckets anyway.  The mission specialists
have all the fun; all I do is command the thing!"

A few hours later, Mercurio gathered his crew in the shuttle's
main compartment.  He filled them in on the shuttle crew's
plan.

"They'll probably be court-martialed for it.  It'll end their careers,"
he concluded.  "I just can't ask them to do it."

Vic broke the silence that followed.

"So, it's Kennedy after all, then?"  Mercurio nodded in the affirmative.

"Look, if anyone doesn't want to do this, we'll go to Dakar.  I'll
say I hijacked the shuttle; hell, let's actually do it, then maybe
these guys'll have a chance of getting off."

The captain looked around the faces that surrounded him; the only
faces he'd seen in person for the last three years.  They were
his crew, his family, and he pretty much knew the answer each
would give in turn as they looked around the circle.

The doctor who started as a medical outcast and was now the world's
unquestioned expert on space medicine.

"Kennedy."

The young South African who'd grown up more in three years than most
men did in a lifetime.

"OK, Kennedy.  I hope that cop I punched out kinda forgot about me,"
he speculated wistfully.

Finally, the once unheralded NASA engineer who'd become a flashpoint
in her own right for her strongly held unorthodox opinions.

"Kennedy."

The captain concluded the unanimous decision as the shuttle crew
floated down from the PMA.

"Colonel, we've been talking, and we just can't ask you to go
to Senegal.  We want you to take us to Kennedy."

The two NASA men looked at each other, and the pilot spoke first.

"Sir, we volunteered for this mission."

"I know, and I thank you.  But you're not throwing your careers away
for us.  Take us to Kennedy."

The NASA men looked at each other, and the pilot spoke for both of them.

"Well, we'll take you where ever you want to go."

"Kennedy," the Captain said with an air of finality.

The shuttle commander looked around the cramped compartment.  Each
Icarus crewman nodded assent.

"Ok, Kennedy it is.  Are we ready to close the hatches?"

The space station crew above gave an affirmative reply.  As they
closed the PMA's hatch, the Captain turned back to his crew.

"Let's go home."
