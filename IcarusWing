James Joyce established the literary maxim that an author doesn't
have to explain what he wrote, and for a long time
I tried to emulate him.

Then I realized something.

I'm not James Joyce.

That statement could be read in several different ways,
primarily either as a cliche stating that I'm not that
good a writer, or that I'm just a different person,
and therefore a different writer, than James Joyce.
The double entendre is deliberate, and I try to
explain these things here, in my Author's Notes.

I wouldn't read them the first time through,
just enjoy the book, then read it again with the notes.
I'll try to provide PDF versions both with and without them.

"Those who do the hard work" was written when watching a Mexican friend
of mine butcher a cow, and his wife would always have a bowl of food for me,
the destitute gringo, thus "I'll thank them for being so kind to me".

I used to have a line in there: "this is a historical novel" to start
setting the stage for the key events that happen in the past - the
dot-com boom, 9/11, the _Columbia_ shuttle disaster

The novel toys throughout with the suggestion that it is, somehow,
maybe, or maybe not, the Great anti-American Novel.  So is it or isn't
it?  If it is anti-American, the novel itself takes a decidedly
tongue-in-cheeck approach to answering that question in the
affirmative.  A whole lot of ominous-sounding "requirements", half of which
turn out to be nothing more than sly little double entendres.  It really
depends on *your* definition what it is to be American!  Only then
can you decide if it is anti-American!

The novel also toys throughout with the idea of being "great",
starting right now on the first page.  Great how?  Great in what why?
If it ultimately sets off a successful Hawaiian revolution in real
life it *might* be regarded as the Great Hawaiian Novel!  Yet the
novel's answer comes on its last page, in its last sentence - it's
great because it's part of the Great Conversation (the allusion here
is to Mortimer Adler and the Great Books program); it's great because
it has something original to add to the Great Conversation, and what
is that?

Of course, "Christ is the answer", but that statement alone
wouldn't put in the Great Conversation, because it's been said
many times before.  Perhaps if I said it exceptionally well,
it'd garner some merit, but something more is needed to truly
add to the conversation.

How about "If you want to achieve a political revolution, a Hawaiian independence
bid makes more sense than flying to Mars"

but I feel that statement's aimed too personally at Elon Musk,
maybe with a "goofball!" thrown in at the end.

Maybe it's just "a secession/independence movement makes more
sense that any cockamamie scheme that will never work".

Or even "secession is a fundamental political right".

Maybe "capitalism is evil", but that's been said before, and in
better ways.  I'm not really hoping to convince my readers
that capitalism is evil, I expect that my supporters already
believe that and my opponents can't be swayed

Maybe "don't expand further into space; fix your problems on Earth instead"

Any way you read it, with the billionaire Elon Musk talking about
colonizing Mars in hopes of solving mankind's problems, this message
seems even more relevant now that when the first edition came out ten years
ago.

	    Requirements for The Great anti-American Novel

[[
Why write this crazy novel, and what are these ominous sounding requirements?

Well, I could just lay out my political and spritual program by writing
an essay that reads like I'm giving a speech, and I've done that before
in things like _My_Confession_ and the like.

This time I decided to aim for "high literature" and decided that the
book had to be some kind of scripted fiction that told some kind of
story wrapped around my ideas.  Some might

T - 2693 days    leftists must be lazy

[[
This is STS-61, and the whole jamming the door shut on the Hubble
telescope scene is straight out of the wikipedia article.
It's Flight Day 4, December 6, 1993.

Readers who are really paying attention, now have a key to all
the dates in the novel.  In particular, neither 9/11 nor
the _Columbia_ disaster should come as any surprise to them.

Of course, I hope the reader notices that the time marker
on this scene predates "0 hour" by some time, and
juxtapose this with the futuristic setting of a spacewalk.

The first edition actually started on the second scene,
the super-hack.  This new opening scene was added to
enlarge the novel a bit (it was too short) and to
provide some more back story for Andrea Yeats.

2001 Mars Obyssey launched on April 7 (Julian 94), 2001, and arrived
on Mars 200 days later on October 24 (Julian 296).  A faster ship would have launched
faster and gotten there sooner.  Let's assume that the midpoint
of the mission would be the same day - Julian 195, July 21, 2001.

If we make May 21, 2001 their launch day (so it takes about four months to get to Mars),
they get there on September 21, 2001.

No, let's move everything up a month, to fit 9/11 in shortly after they arrive.

Launch on April 21, 2001 and arrive on August 21, 2001.

"_Columbus_, Houston, for EVA."

[[
I hope Jeffrey Hoffman doesn't mind that I replaced him with crazy Andrea Yeats.

Is she crazy?  Her namesake sure is.  The "real" Andrea Yeats murdered
her five children in a bathtub, and explained the next day to a prison psychiatrist:

"It was the seventh deadly sin.  My children weren't richteous.  They stumpled
because I was evil.  The way I was raising them, they could never be saved.
Better for someone else to tie a millstone around their neck and cast
them in a river than stumble.  They were going to perish."

"I was so stupid!  Couldn't I have killed just one to fulfill the prophecy?
Couldn't I have offered Mary?"

"Are they in heaven?"

https://web.archive.org/web/20070902232526/http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/special/drownings/1268306.html

Also, get this - her husband was a former NASA engineer,
with a fundamentalist Christian streak that told him
to procreate as much as possible.  This went against medical advice
from family psychiatrists who warned both of them against
stopping her antipsychotic medication while carrying a child,
but he insisted, and she gave in.

So why don't I change the name?

First, the character has long been Andrea Yeats for many years before I knew of this story.

Changing the name doesn't seem right.

What's the point of changing the name?  To cover it up?

All of this needs to be disclosed!  These facts
go in the author's notes, not buried and dug up years
from now by some investigative reporter.

My detractors will leap onto the alarming similarities
beween a crazed Christian who murdered her children, the crazed Andrea Yeats who
gives away everything she owns, and the crazed author,
some nutcase Chrisitian communist
who imagines that he's "Eagle Six".

But here's the thing.

What happened to her children?

Ask any Christian minister what happened to Andrea Yeats' children.

They were aged 7, 5, 3, 2, and 6 months.

I'll bet most of them will tell you that they went to heaven.

And that she paid the ultimate penalty.

It seems brutally extreme to murder your children to ensure their salvation,
but if you're convinced that most people in the world are damned...

  It seems brutally extreme to murder office workers and military
  officers with hijacked jet planes, but if you think you're
  going to heaven as a martyr...

  It seems extreme to give everything away because some Bible verse
  (Luke 14:33) says you can't be a disciple otherwise,
  but if you believe the Bible is the inerrant Word of God...

  It seems extreme to keep praying to some imaginary God and trying
  to figure out what He wants you to do, but if you beleive that
  he's real...

Rabbits will kill their young.

When I was a boy, we kept pet rabbits in cages made of wire mesh, to
make it easier to collect their droppings.  As an adult, I am ashamed
of how we treated them, but I digress.  If a rabbit became pregnant,
we put straw in their cage so they could nest.  They would have
preferred straw all the time, so much so that when a female (was it Brownie?) became
pregnant unbeknownst to us, she killed her entire litter immediately
after birth by breaking their necks.

Andrea Yeats was diagnosed with psychosis.

Psychosis is, by definition, a loss of contact with reality.

When my psychiatrist friend told me that, I asked isn't
everyone psychotic, to some extent?

Could a religious experience like St. Francis's vision at
San Damiano be diagnosed as a psychotic episode?  Wouldn't an atheist
conclude that there is nothing else it could be?

Furthermore, the primary cause of psychosis is schizophrenia.

I have known two schizophrenics for long enough to conclude that
their voices are probably real and that they are possessed by demons.

Psychosis usually begins in early adulthood and affects approximately
three percent of the population!

I am personally part of that population.  When I was twenty-three years
old, I experienced a vision, as I described in _Bicycling_Across_America_.
Over the next twenty eight years, I've experienced at least another
half dozen similar experiences, and been in the presence of others
during their similar experiences at least twice.

The atheists believe I'm psychotic and I believe I've been touched by God.

I also believe that some portion of the psychotic population has been misdiagnosed
because their experiences are, in fact, real, either holy or demonic in origin, but real.

   I personally reject atheism, in part, because I find it impossible to
   beleive that what 30,000 people witnessed at Fatima was a mass
   hallucination, a mass psychotic episode, or anything of the kind.

Where does that leave me with Andrea Yeats?  Crazy?  Psychotic?

Who knows?

Andrea finishing aligning the screwdriver with the bolt and pressed
the drive button.  She heard no sound but felt the vibration through
her gloved hand as she watched the bolt spin down, tighten, and lock.
Then she let go of the screwdriver and let it float away on its
tether.

[[
I have no idea what kinds of tools they had on that mission.

Do we really have "screwdrivers that require no torque to turn" (first
edition)?

Is that something you would actually use?  If you were floating
free yes, but probably not if your feet are tethered, as in this
scene.

A "mass spectrometer the size of a shoebox"?  Good grief, what for?
Sounds good, though, high-tech, it stays in.  Maybe I even
read about it somewhere.

She was suspended by the side of an open access panel on the Hubbel
Space Telescope, her feet secured in a foot restraint, a $100,000 bag
of one-of-a-kind tools dangling in the vacuum next to her.
A screwdriver with an LCD
screen that displayed its torque and speed settings.  A mass
spectrometer the size of a shoebox.  Levered clamps custom designed to
insert and remove circuit panels of which no more than a dozen had
ever been manufactured.  Though she floated forty feet over the space
shuttle's open cargo bay, she had no fear of falling.  Had she
released her feet, she would only have drifted away gently, the
slight pressure from her foot pushing her up, away from the shuttle
bay, instead of down.

Based on the pictures I've seen from space, I probably haven't imagined
enough clouds.  Seriously.  There are plenty in this scene, but as we
go on...

The sun blazed gloriously and bathed her entire side of the shuttle in
a dazzling white light, but it would be inaccurate to say that there
was not a cloud in the sky.  A swirling tropical depression was
clearly visible over the South China Sea, extending from Guangzhou to
Kyushu, the counterclockwise swirl of its cumulus clouds clear
evidence of the ``forces'' envisioned by Coriolis.  Much of Japan's
southern archipelago was obscured by the storm system, but clear skies
over Hokkaido and Honshu left the island chain distinct and instantly
recognizable.

Israel.  A desert land cut though by springs, wells, and one great
river that watered its fields and inundated its history.  Narrow winding streets cut through
limestone walls of an ancient city.  Beachfront condos and gleaming glass skyscrapers.  Cool resorts
on the shore of Lake Galilee.  Teenage soldiers toting Galils.
Yad Vashem.  The Occupied Territories.  Olive trees and palm fronds.

[[
I visited for a week when I was fourteen, with my parents and our Church group, led by Pastor Simmons.

I remember the hotel on Lake Galilee; they greated us with a platter of fresh fruit.  And I saw the
assult rifles, though I have no idea if they were Galils.  We went to the Garden of Gethsemane,
and the Church of the Nativity.  I don't remember Yad Vashem; I
don't think we went there.
]]

Andrea: _Who's_ever_grown_an_olive_tree_in_space?_

What would it take?  Needless to say, no living creature, not
even a tree, could survive in a vacuum, so it would have to be encased
in an aluminum satellite.  The sapling could be grown in a hydroponic
garden, but even a single full grown olive tree would never fit in the
space shuttle, or even the _Mir_ space station.  A custom satellite,
with dozens of specialized devices, would be required, along with a
constant resupply of water, carbon dioxide, and plant nutrients
without which the tree would die.  Direct sunlight, with its bizarre
45 minute day, would hopelessly upset the plant's circadian rhythm.
Unless its satellite was positioned in an geosynchronous orbit, the tree
would need to be shielded from natural sunlight and instead nurtured,
if that were the word, under artificial grow lights.  Even when full
grown, no man ever would relax from his labors under the shade of its
boughs, but would instead retrieve the olives by servicing the
satellite, likely garbed in a pressure suit, much as she was now.

Andrea looked again at her surroundings.  Any living creature that
might have stowed away aboard the Hubble had long since perished in
the harsh vacuum of space.  Astronomers had no worries of a mouse
gnarling its electrical cables, or a gnat foiling its pristine optics.
The most careful forensic examination of its surface might reveal the
RNA of a cold virus that had slipped unnoticed into the clean room
where it was assembled.  If this race of man
perished in a nuclear holocaust or a deluge from God, the satellite
would simply wait for radio instructions that would never come, or
perhaps continue to image distant galaxies and quasars according
to some pre-programmed command sequence,
oblivious to war or revolution, famine or plague,
transmitting images to a dead
planet into whose atmosphere it would one day spiral and burn.  Even
the inanimate satellite required a constant resupply of fuel from the
planet below.

_What_are_you_doing_up_here?_

Servicing the Hubble helped develop the tools and techniques needed
for men to live in space.  Plans were well underway to launch an
International Space Station, and its daunting assembly schedule made
working on the Hubble look like assembling an erector set.  After the
ISS, Mars was the next logical step...

_A_cold,_lifeless_planet_...

Andrea gazed again at the planet beneath her.  Japan was rapidly
disappearing over the western horizon, replaced by the undulating
expanse of the Pacific Ocean.  The light blue tinge of the Asian
continental shelf quickly gave way to the deep blue of the ocean
deep, unbroken except for some wispy cirrus clouds and in one spot,
the glare of reflected sunlight.

[[
See what I mean about the clouds.
]]

Yet even here, there was life.  _Even_here?_ Earth's oceans teemed
with life!  From the great leviathans hunted nearly to extinction for
their blubber and oil to the microscopic plankton they filtered
through their baleen plates, and the myriad of fish, crustaceans,
jellyfish and sea mammals in between.

_Are_you_talking_to_anyone_about_Christ?_

Well, what was the most important thing?  Wasn't it preaching the Gospel?
Isn't that what her religion taught?

_What_are_you_doing_up_here?_

[[
Oh, no, this is some kind of Christian novel, isn't it?

I'd better state some creed
to say what I believe in, so people can
argue about whether or not I'm a Christian.

I believe that the psychotic episodes I've experienced
are not, in fact, hallucinations.  I'm referring
to stuff like this, from my essay _Bicyclying_Across_America_:

    In the next minute, I had what I would describe as a mental lightening
    bolt. I suddenly saw that my problems were of my own creation - I was
    relying on myself instead of on faith. I was going to ride the bike; I
    was going to put up the tent; I had the money to buy food. I saw that
    what I needed to do was get rid of all that. The next day was Labor
    Day and everything was closed, so I rode on the Flagstaff. Here my
    bike trip ended.

    I agonized for a day or two, then committed myself. On Wednesday
    morning, crying, I took the bike for a last ride. Finding a local
    church, I gave the pastor the bike and most all the gear, telling him
    to do what he wanted with it. With my last money, I bought a pack to
    carry, and paid for postage to mail my wallet, contact lenses, and few
    other things home.

These are not hallucinations.

They're genuine spirtual revelations from God, more
precisely the Holy Spirit, which is, to me, a omniscient force
with foreknowledge of the future,
seemingly infinite wisdom, and also love.

Another amazing experience came one night in Anchorage after I
preached to a group of about two hundred men.  I had been attending
a large men's Bible study, on the Book of Revelation, for four or five months.  At each
weekly meeting, one of the leaders would give a message, but
at the final meeting, everyone was given the opportunity
to stand up and speak.  I stood up and spoke, though I
was scared to do it, not scared of any physical violence,
but scared of public speaking on a controversial topic.
I remember speculating on the possibility
that democracy could be one of the beasts in the prophecy,
because "the whole world marvels after the beast, and
nobody can defeat the beast in war."  I remember being
jeered from the audience, too, which included a former
Lieutenant Governor of Alaska, I was told.

On the drive back to the University of Alaska,
my friend the driver told me that if my message
was true it would have resonated with people,
and it didn't.

After he dropped me off at the Science and Engineering
Building, I went inside, as I usually did, and set up
my laptop to do some late work on whatever the
project of the day was.

I soon shut my laptop.  I was overcome with a
powerful sensation that I can only decribe as
"the peace of God, which passes all understanding".
I couldn't do any work.  I just packed my bag
and walked back to my homeless campsite enveloped
in this overarching sensation of peace.

How can make decisions without the guidance of this Spirit?

I'm always wondering if some little "feeling" is the
guidance of the Spirit, because I've felt it so powerful and so real,
and I'm always looking for it?

How can I decide what plane to get on without its guidance?

That's an allusion to _My_Confession_, which tells the
story of how I got on the wrong plane in Anchorage,
even though I had clear guidance from the Spirit
not to do it.

So that's the Holy Spirit.

I pray to Jesus.  I started praying to Jesus one day in
Anchorage.  I used to remember the exact date, but I forgot.
I had prayed to "Our Father, who Art in Heaven" for years,
since I was a child, but I starting thinking about
the Book of Revelation, how Jesus said
"He who conquers, I will grant him to sit with me on my throne
as I myself conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne"
and how in the Book of Mathew He said
"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me"

I concluded that Jesus was a pretty powerful guy with
all that authority given to Him, and there was no reason
not to pray to Him because He might not be identically God, or because said to pray to
"Our Father".  So I did.  Just walking around the
tennis courts in Delaney Park Strip, I prayed
fervently to Jesus, maybe for the first time in my life.

Over the course of the next fifteen minutes, I witnessed
the most amazing rainbow display that I have ever
seen in my life.  First one brilliant rainbow appeared
in the sky to the southeast.  Then a second
rainbox appeared within it!  Finally even
a third rainbow appeared!  I've never witnessed a
triple rainbow at any other time in my life,
and the three nested rainbows dominated the sky.

Coincidence?  Appearing within minutes of a fervent
prayer to Jesus?  It's possible, but I see a connection.

So I started praying to Jesus, and I still do!

Ahh, yes, my childhood.  You knew it was a religious
novel already because I had mentioned my trip to
the Holy Land, didn't you!?

Yes, I was raised as a Christian boy from birth,
and of course this influenced me greatly.

Many of us feel that the message of Jesus is
so important that we instill it in our children.

Yet make no mistake - I'm a Christian because I
believe in Jesus Christ.  I beleive in Him
mainly because of what I've read about Him
in the Bible.  He sounds like a pretty cool master,
and I decided to take my chances with Him years ago.

I truly hope 


Men start pursuing selfish aims, and fall away from God.

The main development computer, scheduled for a hardware upgrade, would
be shut down in less than an hour.  His e-mails, mostly notes from
various employees turning the day's outage into an excuse for a
holiday weekend, offered no reason to change plans.  He logged out,
shouldered his laptop case and headed for the server room.

Back in the nineteen seventies, those halcyon days when spam came in
cans and porn sites were on Gay Street, Brian Kernighan, inventor of
UNIX, demonstrated that a compiler could covertly alter the programs
it compiled, including itself, and who would write a compiler without
having a compiler already?  A Kerninghan virus is particularly
effective on closed, heavily customized systems, like those of a
router manufacture wanting custom, proprietary software to take
advantage of custom, proprietary hardware.

Burns slid his key card through the slotted box.  A light turned
green; a bolt clicked back; a line printer rattled.  Above an elevated
floor that covered a halon fire extinguisher system were
floor-to-ceiling arrays loaded with switch hubs, firewalls, RAID
arrays, and, in the corner, a massive air conditioner plant to
dissipate the heat.  A brand new multi-processor system sat, unpowered
and silent, while several workers chatted leisurely amongst themselves,
including one sporting a shock of red hair.

[[
Been in too many of these kinds of rooms to remember.  I think
CAD/IG, where I worked for the U.S. Naval Academy, had a halon
system, and I think the engineering lab at Maryland had one, too,
but it had been at least partially disconneted.
]]

"Hey, Burns, what's up?"

'Red' Rimdew, named since childhood by the color of his hair,
specialized in diving into stalled projects and finishing
them by pounding out code.  Burns, really more a designer than a
programmer, respected Red for his staying power with the boring tedium
that the finicky machines imposed on their masters.  Yet today no
deadlines loomed...

[[
Red is a tribute to an old workmate (the name's an anagram), who absolutely
specialized in pounding out code while I dreamed up fancy designs.

But he doesn't have red hair.
]]

"Want to hit the bay?"

An afternoon of sailing on Red's thirty-six-foot Catalan
was an enticing idea, but Burns thought first
of the weeks
spent designing and writing his laptop's "screen saver";
the hours spent drilling 
dozens of variants on a thirty-second procedure; the flowcharted contingency
plans on an encrypted hard drive; his roommate waiting at the
apartment with a network link and two phone lines.

Burns: "No, thanks.  I gotta get this done."

He crossed to the other side of the room, where he was working on a
tricky install in one of the test machines.  Somehow, he just couldn't
seem to get the settings right.  Once set up, he emailed his roommate,
_How_about_lunch_? _Sounds_fine,_ came the reply.

Forty five minutes later, with the main system shut down and two of
the three techs out of the room, Burns sent another email,
_Let's_try_Bogart's_.  Back in the apartment, his friend skimmed down a
list of local restaurants and the names they translated into, then
picked up the phone.  A minute later, the third tech was called out to
answer a phone call.  Burns had contemplated taking a shot of
J.D. that morning to steal himself for this moment, but decided that
he had to be absolutely sober in case _anything_ went wrong.

He dashed across the room as the door closed.  It was one of the
scenarios he had drilled for.  He connected two cables, hit a
three-key sequence on the laptop, and ventured a glance at the door.
Nobody.  The laptop beeped.  He disconnected both cables and dashed
back across the room.  It would become one of the world's most
infamous hacks.  It had taken less than 15 seconds.

_Forget_Bogart's;_let's_hit_Vacarro's_! he fired off, floated
back out to the parking lot, tossed the laptop in the back seat, fired
up a sneak-a-toke, cranked the tunes and floored the rag-top all the
way home.

[[
A little foreshadowing.  He fires up a sneak-a-toke, and drug use is about to be promoted in the next chapter.
]]


T - 370 days    drug use must be promoted

Mercuriou: "The routers run the network; hell the routers _are_ the
network.  You control the routers, you control the network.  You're
God.  I'm telling you, this thing's like super-hack."

Vic: "Burns."

From his perch on the couch, Marc Mercuriou nodded in assent.  In his early
thirties and an inch under six feet, Burns' roommate was indifferently clad.  What
differentiated him was his refusal to allow a television into the
apartment; an hour each day, timed on a stopwatch, devoted to reading
Latin; a framed letter of rejection from the University of Chicago.
Vic Antonov, waiting in the kitchen for the teakettle to boil, was
nearly ten years older, heavy set with a bristling mustache that often
covered a mischievous smile.

[[
Oh, captain, my captain.  Probably the character I identify with the most.  He's me, more than anything else.

He's a classic flawed Greek hero, while Andrea Yeats is the Ayn Rand style superman, with no major character flaws.

Is Mercuriou's fatal flaw his ego?  He's super talented, he's an overachiever, and it's gone to his head.

His rejection of classical morality is another great flaw.  He doesn't seem to be bound by
any inhibition on theft or even kidnapping.

In the classic Greek mold (aluded to by the Greek mythological character in the title), his flaw
must somehow destroy him, like Odysseus murdering his father, marrying his mother, and finally
putting his own eyes out when he learns the truth.  In our story, the flawed hero flashes through
a brilliant plan that stokes his ego and gives him worldwide fame only to see it collapse in a moment as he
attempts to push the envelope one too many times.

If there's any kind of twist to this, it's that as a suicidal wreck, instead of putting
his eyes out, he turns to God, achieves one last great impossible triumph, then dies in a blaze of glory.

Does he want fame to give him a platform for his grievances more than he wants Mars?  I think so, but
he's also swallowed his own B.S. to the point where he really thinks Mars is the solution.

Why does anyone follow him?

It's easy to say "because he stole a billion dollars", because lots
of people _will_ follow a rich man because he's rich.
Burns is an amoral technocrat who follows him because he gets to play with high-tech toys.
Alister follows him because he's young and easily duped by the speeches.
Vic never really follows him, and neither does Andrea; both are there to offer themselves as a moral anchor.

Studying anything for a solid hour a day produces results quickly.  I'd pick Spanish over Latin, though.

I wasn't rejected by the University of Chicago, but I was accepted by MIT, and choose to go to Maryland instead.
I've even got a degreee to show for that bonehead move.

Vic's appearance and mannerisms are patterned off of Vic, and I don't remember his last name,
who was another extended guest at Shiloh,
the Christian community in Sulphur Springs, Arkansas where I spent a summer.
]]

Vic: "So what's the point?  Why?"

Mercuriou: "We're going to Mars."

Vic furled his brows and looked at him like he had just claimed to
have discovered extraterrestrial life.  Mercuriou stared back
impassively, his heart racing.  No, he was serious.  Walking into the
living room, Vic had to return to the kitchen for teabags, as the mugs
contained nothing but hot water.

Mercuriou: "Burns' got a plan, and I think it'll work.  Spaceflight is
perfectly doable; that's been demonstrated over and over for fifty
years.  The problem is money; the problem is always money!  You can't
fly without money, you can't ride without money; no money means no
electricity, no house, no food; now they sell bottled water 'cause
half the planet can't drink the crap that comes out of the tap, and a
dollar on number seven won't get you to number eight!"

He produced a pack of fifty-dollar bills and fanned them on the table.

Mercuriou: "Well, now we've got money."

Vic stood in the doorway holding something forgotten.

Mercuriou: "Let's just say that there are some Keno systems out there
that are no longer completely random."

Vic: "Marc, this isn't like you, you're not a thief."

Mercuriou: "Well, maybe I've changed."

[[
No, this isn't going the way our captain had hoped.
]]

Vic looked straight into his eyes.  He had changed, as all men do.
Yet now he switched his tone of voice to that of a teenager stammering
to explain a 2 A.M. party to his parents.

Mercuriou: "I'm going to Mars, Vic!  I need the money!"

Vic sighed, handed one of the mugs to his young friend and sat down.

Mercuriou: "They're gonna catch me, Vic.  It's just a matter of time.
I'm into too much cash!  I gotta be gone... like _really_ gone!"

Vic: "Mars, huh... Did you steal the money to go or are you going
because you stole the money?"

Mercuriou didn't answer.  Couldn't answer.

Vic: "Why are you doing this, Marc?  What's it all about... really?"

Finally, they went for a walk, out into the high summer of the New
Mexico mountains, hot and dry, a day that made Mercuriou wish for a
convertible, a surf board, and Waikiki Beach before it
turned into Sim City.  They were at the end of a long
driveway that wound between a fifty-foot cliff rising to the left and
a dry riverbed on the right.  He paused and inhaled deeply, saving the
aroma of desert flora.

[[
Can I slip a Hawaiian allusion into every chapter, or is that overdoing it a bit?
]]

Vic lead him down a dirt path through the scrub to the door of a
second trailer some distance away.  It looked much like the first one,
except that all of the window curtains were drawn.  Closer inspection
revealed that white drywall backed the curtains, making it impossible
to see in or out.  Vic unlocked a padlock and led the way in.

An overwhelming smell hit Mercuriou -- skunk.  Inside, the trailer had
been stripped of its original furniture and fixtures.  The main room,
some thirty feet long, was lined on both sides with plastic tubs
raised about a foot off the floor.  Inside the tubs were perhaps a
hundred potted cannabis plants, each sporting a bushy top of their
distinctively branching five-part leaves.  Two rows of grow lights
hung down from the ceiling on chain links that could be adjusted in
length as the plants grew upward.  A child's toy pool half full of
liquid fertilizer ran off the same timer as the lights and also caught
the runoff as the liquid percolated back down from the plants.  An air
conditioner hummed in the window, and a dehumidifier discharged into
the pool the water it condensed from the air.  Another hour of small
talk found them back out in front of the cars, intoxicated with a
full-body high that they were just beginning to experience.

[[
A college friend had a grow room in his closet,
that's what the descriptive text is based on.

Why is there drug use infused throughout this novel?  Well, I'm
high right now while I'm writing this!  I like to smoke weed
and write; it's fun, and I put a lot of prayer into my writing.

Smoking weed's not so great like other things, like driving.
I've never had an accident while high, but I've driven
right past a cutoff, continued another ten miles down
the wrong road, and been left wondering why the Interstate
just ended in downtown Indianapolis.

It's not too good for interacting with other people,
unless it's OK if they get you silly and stoned.
Sometimes it _is_ OK; get on with it!

Sometimes it's really important to make a good first
impression, and I don't want to be intoxicated.

Often times I don't know in advance, so I'm probably
high more than I should be.

At this point, I'm going to stop, because I think
I've been warned to stop.  I could be wrong,
but I think I've got a clear warning to stop.

But like I said, I like to smoke and write,
so the novel is, in some sense, infused with marijuana,
so we leave those scenes in and claim they
belong on symbolic grounds.

All of the scenes in an early draft were scored and
either improved or dropped to get every scene in
the novel to a 5-star rating.  By scene, I mean
every T-labeled chapter.

And yes, a bunch of more superfluous text was purged
to the novel's git history on github.
]]

Mercuriou: "I'll play their money game... I'll get out there and 'hustle', I'll
'compete', I'll rip and claw my way to the top, and when I get there,
I'll turn around and ram their global capitalist system right back
down their throats."

Vic: "How often do you pray, Marc?"

Mercuriou: "Right now, my only prayer is that Burns can get us into
orbit!"

Vic: "I need some time to think about this."

Mercuriou nodded and left.  Vic stood standing in the shade, watching
the driveway down which the car had disappeared.  The dust settled,
and nothing disturbed the scene except the buzzing of dragonflies.

Vic: "This will require a vision quest."


T - 355 days    religion must look like a waste of time

[[
So, the novel makes religion "look like a waste of time"
in that it presents religion as very time consuming,
but in a hopefully positive light.

Some atheists will read this chapter as confirmation of
its subtitle, that spending this much effort chasing
after something that does not exist is truly a waste
of time.

Yet my hope is that the reader's response to Vic's
vision quest is positive.  He emerges from this
experience having a made a decision that will
shape the course of the rest of his life,
and he's done so by gaining clarity about what's
really on the line.
]]

The entire eastern sky was lit a brilliant red hue, as if a pane of
clear red glass had been slipped in behind the mountains and lit from
below.  Eyes closed, wrapped in a light Indian blanket, Vic awaited
the dawn.  A bright yellow light pierced out from a gap in the
mountains and began to widen into the orb of the sun.  Though
conscious of the light, Vic put off opening his eyes.

One of his favorite prayer spots, the desert canyon looked like a
giant had slashed through the brown hills with a knife and the desert
had bled a river.  Pristine granite boulders blanketed the slopes
fifty feet on either side of the water.  Cactus and scrub brush
covered the surrounding land.  Amid patches of sandy beach, swirling
pools and murmuring cascades were two-foot diameter logs wedged
between boulders twenty feet above the water line, mute witnesses to
the tropical cyclones that, two or three times a century, settled over
the canyon and filled the arroyo with the raging waters that had
carved it out over the ages.  The water was drinkable, and a gentle
breeze often discouraged insects.  There were flat rocks to lie out on
in the sun, and shady crevices to evade the heat during the peak of
the day, not to mention ample bathing spots in the cool river.

[[
This spot exists, pretty much as described, in the Sierra de la Laguna
near the southern tip of the Baja Peninsula.  Just drive up
the cannon road from Santiago to El Refugio.
]]

Vic had put this off for weeks, inventing one excuse after another why
he couldn't do it just yet.  He had to let his clients know he'd be
gone for several days.  He had to find someone to take care of the
cat.  There was something on TV he wanted to see.  The moon wasn't the
right phase.  He wanted to finish the book he was reading.  It was
already too late today.  It was still pretty early, he could putter
around for another hour or so before leaving.

The truth was, though Vic had decided to undertake a vision quest, and
knew intellectually that this was the course he wanted to follow,
neither was he looking forward it.  Days of silence and
solitude.  He had done this before, and knew what he was getting into.

[[
The vision quest is a native American tradition practiced in various
forms.  See, for example, Tom Brown, _The_Tracker_.
]]

He opened his eyes, turned around and looked east.  The sun was the
distance of a man's fist over the horizon.  The doctor rearranged his
blanket so he could contemplate its orb, then spread his arms apart
and closed his eyes again, basking in the gentle warmth of a new born
day. _Another_day_among_days_. _Uncountable_as_our_breaths_of_air_

_Marc_Mercuriou_wants_to_fly_to_Mars_.  Vic turned the thought over in
his mind for the hundredth-odd time.  He drifted back over the years,
the college parties, the mathematical discussions and philosophical
debates, the night Burns drove home on three hits of acid, the
program, the lawsuit, the expulsion.  His head snapped back up.  Had
he been sleeping?  He wasn't sure.  The sun hadn't moved, or had it?
Perhaps it was infinitesimally higher in the sky.

[[
Is this stream of consciousness, Miss Selwocki?

(my senior English teacher in high school)

There might be too much third person description here to really
% make it stream of consciousness, à la Poe's _The_Tell-Tale_Heart_.
make it stream of consciousness, a la Poe's _The_Tell-Tale_Heart_.
Maybe Vic should narrate the whole
chapter in the first person, but then I think it clashes too much
stylistically with the rest of the novel.  What's being narrated
are his thoughts and perceptions, though, so yes, I think this
is stream of consciousness!
]]

_Marc_Mercuriou's_flying_to_Mars_.  Vic laughed out loud, softly.
What really were the chances?  Yet Burns was involved, so who could
say?  _Gimme_a_perfecta_on_those_two_.  And they say they've got
some kind of super-hack, no, that he could believe.  If Burns wrote
it, they probably did control half of the Internet.  Burns had always
led the mathematical discussions, and rarely participated in the
philosophical debates.

[[
At first I had "a pair to draw to", but it's too much of a known cliche.

I almost left it in.  Maybe some people haven't heard the expression before,
but I would still prefer something original.

How about "Put a perfecta on those two" or "Bet a perfecta on those two"?

The horse race bettor would most likely call the bookie and say something like
"gimme a perfecta on Sunshine Boy and Shoelaces".
Also, it's a perfecta, not an exacta, because
Vic doesn't care which order (1-2 or 2-1) they come in, and as an experienced horse
bettor, let's say, knows the difference between perfecta and exacta.

Burns doesn't care about the philosophical debates because he is an amoral technocrat.
]]

The sun crept higher and the desert began to heat.  Vic unfurled
himself from his blanket and spread it out as a ground cloth.  He
thought of all the stuff he could be _accomplishing_ right now.  He
needed to transplant those seedlings, and take more cuttings.  The
fence along the riverbed still needed to be repaired after the storm.
He could be making lasagna for lunch, ahhh, lasagna, he could go back
now and at least have it for dinner.  Drive into town for the noodles,
tomatoes from the garden, cheese, he had Ricotta but needed Parmesan.

Vic physically shook himself.  _What_are_your_priorities_? Is it the
perfect baked lasagna or discerning the Great Spirit?
_Some_people_go_through_life_for_the_lasagna_.

[[
Dare I call this accidental foreshadowing?

It was actually here long before the dinner scene on Landing Day,
but it fits in nicely.  Is it really foreshadowing if the author
hadn't thought up the foreshadowed scene yet?
]]

Had the sun moved?  He wasn't sure.  _We_waste_so_much_time_, he
almost cried.  Of course, after a while, you know that you'd be
filling the hours with all the _distractions_ - television, food,
drugs, games, books, sex, talking, walking, driving, cleaning.  Out
here, alone, you realize that this is what you waste seven times a
week, and then we die.

Vic stood up and stretched.  The strict Indian vision quest required
not only fasting and sleep deprivation, but was also done naked and
confined to an area no bigger than a patio.  Of course, the strict
Benedictine monk arose at three in the morning to pray, and the strict
Buddhist drank no water after sunset.  Vic fasted and prayed, but was
clothed and allowed himself a somewhat wider leash.  He climbed down
to the water, hopping from boulder to boulder, then striped naked and
bathed.  The stream was still cool, and the morning breeze imparted a
definite chill that turned it downright cold, but in this place, the
rushing arroyo was a luxury that Vic indulged.  He plunged his head
under a ten-foot waterfall and whooped out loud, then stretched out
and floated on his back in the pool at the waterfall's base.  Emerging
from the stream after a time, he laid naked on one of the boulders,
waiting for his skin to dry.

[[
I learned about the Indian vision quest by reading Tom Brown.
For better or for worse, I was never much to go looking for
a teacher (the thought never occurred to me), so I just
tried it on my own, at first, when I was 22, with a tent set up in a stand
of trees a mile from my house.  At the end of _Bicycling_Across_America_
I berated myself for eating and sleeping and found that all I achieved
was to reject God's provisioning and confuse my discernment with fatigue.

There's still something to be said for a good fast.

I don't like the idea of sleep deprivation, though,
and fasting must be balanced with an awareness for God's provisioning.
]]

_If_you_go_, _you_might_never_come_back_, his own voice practically
spoke in his head.  _Well_, _no_, he answered,
_one_day_I_won't_come_back_.  One day he might be driving down the
highway, or walking to the store, and in the next moment meet the
Great Spirit.  Maybe he would pick the day and time himself, Lord knew
he had contemplated it enough.  Might he go like some of his patients,
lingering, faltering, fighting death every step of the way?
_Just_not_like_my_father_, please God, _not_like_my_father_, not
witless and lost in his own home, surrounded by the family he couldn't
tell from strangers.

[[
That's my dad.  He lasted three and half years with permanent brain damage after
a car accident at age 83.
]]

_We're_all_going_to_die_. _It's_how_we_live_that_defines_us_.

The sun was now halfway to its zenith.  Slowly, Vic dressed, then
returned to his blanket.  Perhaps later he would indulge in another
bath.  Hunger was present, but by the third day it manifested itself
more as fantasy than as any physical need.  A pi\~na colada.  That's
what he wanted -- a pi\~na colada, made fresh from coconuts and
pineapples, pureed in a blender with only a flavoring of rum.

_Mars!__He_can't_be_serious_.  Yet he was.  Vic had known Mercuriou
too long to suppose that he was joking, too well to suspect that he
was incompetent, and too dear to consider that he was insane.

Or not.  Their encounter had been shocking.  How much he had changed!
They were like children who had grown up in a nursery, with cartoon
wallpaper and colorful mobiles, and only occasional flickers of a
distant fire glimpsed through the window.

"Men with guns on a cruise ship", specifically, the _Achille_Largo_.

Briefly, four Palestinian terrorists tried to use an
Italian cruise ship, the _Achille_Largo_, to smuggle semiautomatic
weapons into Israel and carry out a mass shooting.
On October 7, 1985, they were surprised in their cabin by
a steward walking in with a fruit tray while they were
cleaning their weapons.  The ship was in port, but in Egypt,
so with their cover blown, they hijacked the ship, holding
the 97 passengers hostage while telling the 450 man crew
to sail the ship to Syria.  The PLO conducted a sham
negotiation led by Abu Abbas, the mastermind of the
operation, that resulted in the terrorists surrendering
to Egyptian authorities and then being quietly released.
When the Americans found out that, contrary to what they had been told,
Leon Klinghoffer, an American passenger of Jewish ancestry,
had been murdered by the young hijackers before Abbas
got a handle on the situation, they responded by
intercepting the commercial passenger jet
carrying the hijackers to Libya, EgyptAir Flight 2843,
and forcing it to land at Sigonella, a NATO base in Sicily.
As soon as the plan landed, it was surrounded not only
by American SEALs but also by Italian Air Force soldiers
and military police, since the U.S. government had decided
not to inform the Italian government in advance, and
forced landings of civilian airliners was most certainly
not in accordance with NATO accords.

Eventually, two of the terrorists served twenty years each in Italian prisons and
the other two served five years each.  Abu Abbas got away, was
captured in Iraq after the U.S. conquest, and died in prison a year later.

Then they emerged from the nursery to find the house engulfed in
flames, and no way out.  Many gave themselves to the fire, toyed with
the fire, learned to play with the fire; many assumed that houses were
meant to burn, as they were made of wood.  Some had cowered in the
basement, or taken refuge in the game room.  Some tried to fight the
fire.  Some jumped.

Without moving, Vic looked to where an iguana had just scampered
across one of the boulders and darted into a crevice.  Life!  The
great mystery!  All around him, the plants, the animals, the birds
in the sky, the algae on
the rocks along the riverbed, all alive!  All part of some greater
consciousness!  What would an iguana know of Mars?  Yet both were
here, the iguana and the red planet, somewhere there in the sky.

I've never been in a slaughterhouse, or you'd probably have better

What did he want?  Did it come down to that?  Maybe it wasn't about
the Great Spirit after all, maybe it was about Victor Antonov...

_Heresy!__Heresy!__We_don't_choice_for_ourselves;_we_must_DO_THE_WILL_OF_GOD!_

[[
The heresy, to be clear, is to ask what we want for ourselves.
The orthodox position, at least in Vic's mind, is to declare
that we must always submit to God.

I tend to lean orthodox, because we humans really don't know
what we're doing, pretty much any of the time.
]]

He awoke with a start.  The sun was visibly down in the western sky.  How
long had he slept?  At first he felt rage at himself for sleeping,
then disappointment, then resignation.
_I'm_sorry,_father,_ he prayed, _I'm_not_a_kid_anymore._
He lay back down on the blanket and slept.

The sun was deep down in the sky when he woke.  He sat and let it slip down
behind the mountains, until shade came to the arroyo, then watched the
light retreat up the slopes until only the summits were in direct sun.

_If_I_were_up_there_, _I_could_still_see_the_sun_, he longed.

%% [[
%% I'm not that good a poet.
%% I'm not even gonna try.
%% How many sunsets have I longed
%% to see the sunset way up high?

Finally the sunlight was gone, leaving
only a blue sky that deepened into purple, then black.  Crickets and
frogs trumpeted the arrival of night.  A rattlesnake slithered silently across
the still warm sand.  Here, away from the city lights, stars began to
emerge, first a dozen, then uncountable thousands.

_The_stars!_ Could there be life out there, too?  How could there not
be, in such vast reaches?  Was the Great Spirit only for this world?
Was there a different Great Spirit for every world, every sun?  And
the Greatest Spirit that transcended all?

_Who_knows?__This_is_dogma._

Dogma.  The bastard son of religion raped by logic.  The
pseudo-science of devising laws that govern a game we do not
understand.  For all the paucity of science, at least the physicists
demanded that their equations predict something real.

_Space._ Vic gazed up at the sky.  Blackness filled with light.
Thousands of tiny blazing suns, subtly hued and interspersed with dim
nebulae.  Orion loomed overhead.  Nor was the sky still.  Not only did
the stars shift through the night, but the lights of airplanes high
above passed slowly through the constellations and the occasional
unannounced meteor would flash past in a fraction of a second.  A
satellite transited overhead, still illuminated by the sun.

[[
I've seen the International Space Station with my naked eye,
at least twice, just after sunset.  It was as clearly visible as an airplane.

The trial.  Marc had lied through his teeth to protect him,
had claimed that nobody else knew the dictionary was copyrighted,
just like he lied when he claimed to have a license.
Three years in prison, and Vic wasn't even charged.

[[
This is a very last addition to Vic's internal monologue,
trying to establish Mercuriou's motives better.

But Mercuriou wasn't all bad.  Quite to the contrary, he
was driven by noble and altruistic goals!  He gave his
program away for free, and thought the dictionary
should be free, too!

[[
The backstory is that Mercuriou and Burns wrote a great language
learning program in college, used a copyrighted dictionary,
got caught, Mercuriou went to jail, and that's why he hates
the United States of America.

It's deliberately here and not in Vic's earlier thoughts
on Mercuriou, because he's recalling things piecemeal.
]]

What now?  Vic didn't expect a booming voice from the heavens, or
a dramatic vision, though such things had been known to happen to
others.  At best, these quests ended in a quiet determination, a
clarification of purpose, a sense of a direction forward.  At worst, a
torrent of tears, disillusionment, and doubt that only time, prayer,
and more vision quests could peer through.

_It's_how_we_live_that_defines_us_.  How was he going to live?
Growing pot in the mountains?  Twenty years in a concrete house?
Blown to bits in some goofball launch attempt?

[[
First edition had "twenty years in the big house with Mercuriou"
to make it clear that he's fantasizing about going to prison
if they get caught before they launch, but this edition sounds better.
]]

_What_if_it_works?_ It was almost impossible.  How could something
this _crazy_ actually _work_?  _Crazy._ Yes, _crazy_.  Maybe he was
ready for something crazy!  He grinned, closed his eyes and tried to
empty his mind, tried to open himself to the Great Spirit.

_I'm_sick_of_being_sane!_ Vic practically lept to his feet at the
thought.  Why be sane?  Why not do something _crazy_?  What's the
worst that could happen - death?  No, jail would be a fate worse than
death.  Death he could handle.  Death meant meeting the Great Spirit.

Vic chuckled, this time aloud.  _Look_at_yourself_. _A_trailer_full_
_of_marijuana_plants_and_you're_worried_about_jail_?  Well, uh, yes,
actually, he was.  _Ahh,_to_hell_with_it._

If he went with Mercuriou, it might be a long, long time before he
returned to this place.  _Or_ever_.  He looked around - the rushing
water in the arroyo could now be heard but no longer seen.  Dim outlines of
rocks and scrub bush surrounded him.  This land was beautiful.  Did he
really want to part with it?  Locked in an air-conditioned tube for who
knows how long? _Some_people_go_through_life_for_the_lasagna._

Orion crept into the western sky.  To the south, a jet airplane
crossed to the east.  Most of the passengers
were asleep, or trying to catch what sleep they could in the
jet-lag abbreviated night.  In a dimly lit cockpit, the pilots guided
the plane along an airway, marked by radio beacons and GPS coordinates,
colorful radar displays and video simulations of the antique
instruments that Earhart and Lindbergh had relied upon.  Do they
peer down into the darkness below?  Do they wonder if anyone was
looking back just then?

[[
More "accidental foreshadowing" to Andrea's dream.

I don't think accidental foreshadowing is really foreshadowing at all.

It's just the author getting lucky.
]]

Once, long ago, a monk kneeled and prayed for guidance.  An angel appeared in
a vision to say that God's will was to serve men and in serving them,
to reconcile them to him.  God?  Serve men?  The monk was incredulous.
Three times the angel repeated the command, then disappeared.

[[
I read a story like that somewhere, but I just can't remember where.

Serve men? Serve Marc? Did Marc need him?  _Oh_my_God,_yes_.  He's a thief!
He's lost his entire moral compass!  _If_this_thing_works_and_he_gets_some_kind_of_stage_...

He was a trial judge.  The murder defendant had been convicted by the
jury, but Vic wasn't convinced.  He wrestled with his conscience.
Dare he overturn the verdict?  Dare he let an innocent man die?  In
the courtroom, spectators laughed, chatted, ate, talked on their phones.
Angry, Vic called for order, pounded on his gavel.  Didn't they
understand that the issue was life or death?  He struggled to deliver
the verdict, started, stammered, started again, and then the
prosecutor spoke.  There was new evidence.  The defendant was
innocent.  The charges were dropped.

[[
It doesn't "mean" or "symbolize" anything really.  I probably had
a dream somewhat like it myself.  It's just supposed to be weird.

Vic trys to think up some interpretation for
it and I slot it right into the plot.  More ammo for
the atheists to say how crazy it is to be guided by dreams.

But I've had some of the spectators as students.
]]

Vic awoke.  Was there light?  Yes, the eastern sky was beginning to
brighten and he could just make out the ridge line of the mountains.
What did the dream mean?  That he was off the hook?  That he had made
the right decision?  Do they mean anything?  He lay on the cool
earth, wrapped in his blanket, watching the stars fade out above.
_Sometimes_the_searching_can_get_in_the_way_of_the_finding._

Another day had past, another had come, and the cycle of life
continued.  He would not fear death; he would not fear jail.  Nor
would he keep living in a house trailer, puttering back and forth to
his hydroponic garden.  He stood up and stretched, then sat still
until it was light enough to see, though not yet dawn.  Slowly he
rolled his blanket, then started down the trail as the sun peaked over
a ridge line.  Halfway to the car, he looked back toward the arroyo,
regretting that he had forgotten to bathe.

[[
His regret at not enjoying the arroyo to the fullest, coupled with his earlier
realization that this might be his last chance to do so,
foreshadows his death.

T - 351 days    school must be a bore

[[
If Herman Melville can put a sermon in the middle of _Moby_Dick_,
then I can put a physics lecture in _Icarus_Wing_!

Hopefully the reader will find it rather long and boring
(just like Father Mapple's sermon),
thus "school must be a bore".

It also provides nice character development for Andrea Yeats.
]]

"Approximation lies at the heart of physics.  We don't use Einstein's
theory of relativity to design a skyscraper, because it's irrelevent.
The distances and speeds relevent to designing even the largest
buildings on Earth produce relativisitic effects so minute that
including them in the design calculations would only complicate the
equations unnecessarily.  On the other hand, relativistic effects must
be accounted for when designing GPS satellites, because the time
measurements required to determine the distance to a GPS satellite are
on the order of nanoseconds, while relativistic effects cause the
clocks on the satellites run faster by about fifty microseconds per
day.  Now, what's bigger, a nanosecond or a microsecond?"

An awkward pause followed, as Andrea waited for a response from her
third period A.P. Physics class.  She continued to wait, knowing that
although the class had not yet studied relativity, they had completed
a section on SI units and should be able to answer the question.  She
began silently counting to ten, and a fifteen-year-old junior, one of
the youngest students in the class, raised his hand and answered as
her internal count reached six.

"A microsecond is a thousand nanoseconds, right?"

"That's right, Jackson.  So the relativistic effects caused by Earth's gravity
introduce an error of about fifty thousand nanoseconds every day in
the satellite clocks, while the speed of light is about a third of a meter
per nanosecond.  The GPS system works by using timing to measure
distance, so if you're off by a thousand nanoseconds, that's going to
introduce an error of about three kilometers, and that's not
acceptable."

Andrea reinforced her point by picking up a dry erase marker and
writing on the whiteboard that dominated the front of her high school
classroom.

GPS.

"Engineers call this a back-of-the-envelope calculation.  It's a real
simple calculation that couldn't be used to actually design a GPS
satellite, but it shows you that if you want to obtain sub-kilometer
resolution, you need to take general relativity into account."

"A big part of mastering physics is to develop an intuitive sense of
when you can approximate and when you can't, and to make these kind of
simple calculations to guide you in that assessment.  Even the
simplest problems would be unsolvably complex if we tried to take
every known physical phenomenon into account."

She picked up a block of wood from her desk and exhibited it before
the class.  They had spent the last month analyzing and measuring
simple machines constructed from blocks, rope, and pulleys.

"We've been studying the motion of these wooden blocks while
completely ignoring their internal structure.  Analyzing all of the
atoms and molecules in this block of wood would be a hopeless task!
Instead, we ignore its atomic structure, its chemical composition, the
biological structure of its cells, its electrical and magnetic
properties, how it deforms under stress, all of it!  We know that if
we exert enough force on this block, it will break into pieces.  We
know that if we heat it hot enough, it will burst into flames.  We're
guided not so much by equations and calculations, but rather by an
intuitive sense that for the purpose of these block-and-pulley
problems, none of that stuff matters."

"This is called the 'Rigid Body' approximation, that these blocks
maintain an exact shape that never changes no matter what kind of
forces we subject them to.  In reality, there are no rigid bodies, any
more than there are frictionless tables or massless pulleys.  All
actual materials, even the hardest diamonds and the strongest metals,
deform somewhat under even the slightest force."

"Rigid body motion is very simple.  A rigid body can translate and it
can rotate.  That's it.  Its state is completely specified by its
position and its orientation."

"So far, we've been using free body diagrams and Newton's second law
to analyze the translational motion of a rigid body.  Now we're going
to perform a very similar analysis for rotational motion."

Andrea walked back to her desk, where she had assembled two simple
machines before class.  Each consisted of a pair of steel weights, a
large one and a smaller one, tied onto opposite ends of a rope which
was looped over a wheel, the axis of which was mounted on a wooden
frame.  The two machine were identical except for the wheels -- one
was made of plastic and the other of steel.

Andrea took hold of the smaller steel weight on the machine with the
plastic wheel, pulled it down towards the floor, then released it.
The larger weight on the other end of the rope caused the wheel to
turn, pulling the smaller weight upward faster and faster, until the
large weight hit the floor.

"This is called an Atwood machine.  Its behavior can be well
understood using the rigid body approximation, but not without taking
the rotational motion of the wheel into account.  The net force on the
wheel is zero, so its center of mass doesn't move, yet it does
rotate."

Andrea now performed the same demonstration on the other machine.  The
weights moved much slower, taking a full ten seconds before the large
weight hit the floor.

"What's the difference between the two machines?"

This time, she didn't even have to start counting.  A girl in the
front row answered immediately.

"The one wheel is heavier than the other."

"Right!  So we can't just ignore the wheel!  Its properties are
critical to understanding the machine, but we need something other
than F equals m a."

Next, Andrea wrote two equations on the board:

NEWTON.

"In a rotational analysis, the analog of force is torque, mass becomes
moment of inertia, and linear acceleration is replaced by angular
acceleration.  We also want to know the axis of rotation; this is an
additional issue that we didn't have to consider in a translational
analysis.  For the Atwood machine, the axis of rotation is obvious,
but that isn't always the case."

Andrea drew a free body diagram on the board: a circle representing
the wheel, two arrows pointing straight down from the sides showing
the pull of the weights on the rope, an arrow pointing straight down
from the center of the circle indicated how gravity pulled down on the
wheel, and a fourth arrow, right next to the third one, pointed
straight up at the center of the circle and represented the reactive
force of the axle.

Andrea spent the next fifteen minutes analyzing the motion of the
Atwood machine.  First, she balanced the forces and demonstrated that
the net force on the wheel was indeed zero, so that its center of
mass did not move.  Next, she showed the class how to compute torque
by multiplying the magnitude of each force vector by its distance from
the center of the wheel and the sine of the angle it made with a line
from the center of the wheel.  Then she introduced the concept of
moment of inertia and discussed how to approximate it in the case of
the wheel using only basic calculus concepts.  Finally, she combined
all of her calculations together to compute the wheel's angular
acceleration and the time required for the weight to hit the ground,
only to discover that she had dropped a two somewhere and had
calculated a time twice the measured value.  Just before the bell
rang, she told the class that there was a slight mistake somewhere in
her algebra, gave them the correct answer, and dismissed them.

After waiting for the halls to clear of teenagers, she walked down to
the nearly deserted cafeteria and grabbed an early lunch from the
school's in-house Subway -- a six-inch turkey sub with a bag of Fritos
and a Coke.  Then she walked back to her classroom and set about
grading first period's collected homeworks.

_I_do_talk_about_Christ..._sometimes._

Have you sold your worldly possessions?  Given the money to the poor?

Andrea leaned back in her chair.  I can't heal the sick or raise the
dead.  I'm not even a doctor, like Story.  I'm an engineer.  All I can
do is teach AP Physics.

Anyway, didn't the church preach the Gospel?

Well, no, not really.  They did, to an extent.  They talk about Jesus,
and the Bible does get read in church every Sunday, but they managed
their churches like corporations.  Budget meetings, profit and loss
statements, the minister's salery; it didn't look anything like Acts 2.
_No_one_claiming_anything_for_themselves,_they_held_all_their_possessions_in_common._

Our churches don't look anything like that today.

So, actually, no, the church didn't really preach the Gospel.  More
precisely, it preached half the Gospel, and practiced half the Gospel.
_The_Laodecian_Church_.  In the Book of Revelation, the church in
Laodecia was judged by God for its lukewarm ministry and condemned to
be spit out of his mouth like a glass of tepid water.

Andrea got down on her knees, right there in her classroom, and
bowed her head to the floor.  _I_don't_know_how_to_obey_you_,
_Lord_, she nearly cried, _please_show_me_what_to_do._

After a minute, she got back up.  Well, what should I do?
_Sell_your_worldly_possessions_and_give_to_the_poor._ Then what?
I need the car to get to school.

Andrea finished off her work day with a pair of Algebra I classes that
may have bored her more than her students, but they came with the job.
In the first class, she handed out a worksheet, then walked around the
room observing the students' work, clarifying for two boys that
factors, but not terms, can be cancelled in a rational function.
Realizing that other students might be having the same problem, she
started the second class with a short lecture on cancellation before
moving on to the worksheet.

_At_least_I_was_able_to_help_some_of_them_with_their_math._

After driving home from work, she put on some linguine to boil, then
called her mom at home in Iowa.  She briefly shared her frustration
with school, but spent more time listening to her mother's frustration
with a flight of concrete steps that eroded badly after every rain,
her concern that the septic system was now forty years old, and her
uncertainty over how much longer she would be able to drive.  After
the phone call, she ate dinner, finished grading the
homework, then began planning the next day's classes.


T - 239 days    curiosity must kill

In 1998, John Pople became the first man in history to win a Nobel
Prize for writing a computer program.  It was called _Gaussian_, and
it numerically simulated Schr\"odinger's equation, the crucial formula
for explaining the complex interactions that formed atoms and
molecules.  _Gaussian_, and programs like it, made it possible to
analyze atomic structures in much the same way as numerical
simulations of Newton's equations made possible the analysis of
planetary movement in solar systems.  For hundreds of years,
scientists had sought the master formulas of a purely mathematical
Theory Of Everything.  Like two teams drilling a tunnel from opposite
directions, physicists and chemists had pursued a crucial thread of
this common quest, the physicists digging deep into the mysteries of
the atom while the chemists measured and categorized the myriad array
of substances.  Then, in the early decades of the twentieth century,
the physicists broke through their side of the tunnel.  Quantum
mechanics, the most spectacularly successful physics theory of all
time, came with one slight caveat -- nobody knew how to solve its
equations.

[[
It's probably going a bit overboard to suggest that _all_ John
Pople did was write a computer program.  He had to design it,
and that was a lot harder than writing it, though he was
a coauthor of the first version, Gaussian 70.

Alister: "Bloody hell!" exclaimed the young South African as he
smacked the side of the computer monitor.  The screen image wavered
and then recovered its form as Burns walked over behind him.  The
engineer was sporting a dark red T-shirt bearing a limerick:

{{	The computer PC revolution }}
{{	has advanced mankind's evolution }}
{{	But the coders use drugs }}
{{	So there always are bugs }}
{{	that impede the machine's execution. }}

[[
The actual cause of bugs is the unrealistic expectation,
implicit in our current approach to software development,
that programmers must anticipate all possible future uses of their code
when writing it.
]]

Alister: "I'd kill this program, but it already died!"

Burns: "Remember, this stuff's primitive," Burns calmly noted.

Alister: "Yeah, yeah," Alister Compton muttered, pushing his chair
violently back from the desk.

Burns: "Think of the Tacoma Narrows bridge collapse.  We've been building
bridges for over two thousand years, and still we occasionally drop one into the
river.  We've been building computers for fifty years.  The
technology moves so quickly because it's so primitive.  All of it --
_Gaussian_, Linux, the web -- a thousand years from now, people
will look back on it like we look back on the pyramids today. How the
hell did they build it with just ropes and
levers?  How did they do quantum mechanics with a number system that doesn't
even form an algebraic field?"

Alister: "It's just so _stupid_!  Three hours wasted for a bloody
semicolon!  How did we invent a new rocket fuel with this crap?"

The office was actually the living room of a large plantation house
that Mercuriou and Burns had converted into an office for a team of a
half-dozen young programmers.  The parquet floors and picture windows
overlooked a sandstone cliff dropping to an expansive ocean beach
fringed by coral.  Waves crashed against a nearby point, surfboards
were stacked in a rack near the beach trail, and broad overhead fans
circulated the sea breeze.  In a pair of curtain-side semis parked
outside hummed a parallel-processing system of more than a thousand
processors.

A few hours later, Alister was working alone, and took the opportunity
to crank the stereo, letting the windows reverberate with the hard
rock beat as a guitar lick arched to its climax.

{{	Everybody says this'll lead you to doom }}
{{     But that don't help you in the... }}

[[
The rock song seems to be concerned your sex life, but
Alister is facing a different kind of doom in a living
room.  Should I change it to a bedroom?
]]

Alister: "Bed-roooom!"  Alister bobbed his head and sang the refrain
out loud.  Twenty three years old, with matted blond hair, he had
left South Africa to study abroad, finished a double major in
chemistry and physics, then stayed in America after graduating.
TenTech was his first job after college.

Yet the young chemist fancied himself a hacker, and Burns had
carelessly allowed Alister to watch him login to their most secure
computer.  Alister now used that password to enter the system and look
around.  Its accounting records showed one program used more than any
other, so he ran it.

It printed twenty lines of output, each line beginning with a date and time,
followed by twenty two digit numbers.  It took Alister only a moment
to realize that no numbers greater than 80 appears, and then to recognize the numbers
as the betting game Kino.

He examined the history, the computer's log of the commands it had run,
and saw that the date and time output by program could be set by the
user.  He ran the program once with the current time, then again
with the time set to an hour in the future.

Half an hour later, drove away in his car, but did not go home.
Instead, he went to a nearby bar, walked in and sat down, ordered a rum and coke,
then settled in to watch the Kino game play out on a T.V. monitor
mounted on the ceiling.

_There's_no_way_, he thought to himself. _This_is_crazy_.

The screen cleared and a new game began.  Brightly colored graphics
portrayed a cue stick deflecting billiard balls into a neat square.
Each ball contained a number - sixteen, then thirty-five, then four.
Alister recognized them immediately.  It was one of the rows
of numbers he had seen earlier.

_Bloody_hell!?!_

A strange feeling of both danger and excitment overcame him.

He left without finishing his drink, and drove home in somewhat of a haze.


T - 238 days    youth must be corrupted

Mercuriou: "What did he see?"

Mercuriou gazed out the window behind his desk, over the ocean
frothing and seething gray-green under a steady rain, reflecting the
chaotic smear of light patterns that radar engineers dubbed "sea
scatter", then morphing into an indistinct horizon where rain met
cloud met ocean.

Burns: "He ran the program."

Today's T-shirt featured a cartoonish caricature of Albert Einstein
smoking a marijuana joint, the smoke wafting up into the air and
forming the equation EMC2.

Mercuriou: "Did he understand what he saw?"

Burns: "Probably.  He's pretty sharp."

Mercuriou: Mercuriou started to laugh, "...so he knows we're thieves!"

Vic: "You think this is funny?"

Mercuriou: "I think it's hilarious!  Our whole operation is made
possible by Burns' super-hack, and now along comes this
twenty-year-old kid who hacks _our_ system!"

Mercuriou: "Now, where are we at?"

Burns: "The older engines work with the new fuel.  We've got a
synthesis pathway, but it can be improved.  We still need an airplane,
spacesuits, launch towers, cargo modules and just about everything
that goes in them, more fuel..."

Mercuriou: "Plus we're short on cash, so we need another big hack."

Burns: "I'm swamped."

Mercuriou: "But we've found a hacker!"

Burns screwed his eyebrows and thought for a moment.

Burns: "He's sharp, real sharp.  One of the best kids I've got, and it
looks like he can hack.  I guess... will he hack... for _us_?"

Mercuriou raised a finger in the air and rose out of his chair, an
adrenaline rush surging within him, like he was asking a stranger out
on a date.

Mercuriou: "Let me take care of that.  Go get Alister."

As soon as Burns was out the door, Mercuriou lept into action, erasing
the whiteboard then rearranging the chairs.  By the time Burns
returned with Alister, Mercuriou was back in his own chair, having
swung it around again, and was leaning back against the desk, watching
the rain pelt against the executive suite's plate glass windows.  Vic
directed Alister to sit in front of the desk, and Burns closed the
door.  The pelting rain and the breaking surf were the only sounds as
Mercuriou watched the streaks of water sliding down the glass and
gazed on toward the reef break beyond.  Finally, he spoke.

Mercuriou: "There was an unauthorized connection to 'genie' from your
workstation last night at 9:43 PM.  It was encrypted, of course, but
we know that it lasted about half an hour, and there are accounting
records."

He turned as he was speaking and Alister's face flushed red.  There
seemed little point in denying the obvious, but it was curiosity that
had driven him; Alister was neither a natural liar nor thief.

Alister: "I saw Burns type that password."

Burns: "You've seen me type the password?"

Alister: "I read it off the keyboard, over your shoulder."

Mercuriou almost snickered again, then covered his mouth with his hand,
recovered, and pressed on.

Mercuriou: "...and what did you see?"

Alister: After an awkward silence, Alister answered. "It's tomorrow's
lottery numbers today."

Mercuriou now got up out of his chair and walked around it.  A deep
calm overcame him.  He visualized himself as an ace closer walking to
the mound in the bottom of the ninth, digging in on the rubber,
looking in for the sign...  He stopped directly behind his chair
and locked eyes with Alister.

Mercuriou: "OK, you figured that out, but it's a lot bigger than that.
This is a _heist_."

Alister: "You're robbing a bank?"

Mercuriou: "We've already cleaned out one, and we're thinking about
taking down another.  We've got to get away, though; we've stolen too
much already.  That's why we need a new rocket fuel."

Alister: "So, you're going... into space?"

Mercuriou: "Mars."

Alister: "Yeah, and I'm Nelson Mandela."

Mercuriou: "This is no joke."

Alister: "What I saw on that computer screen was nooo space shuttle."

Mercuriou: "There will be!  Not exactly like NASA's; we've got a
different design.  But I'm no petty thief!  We've stolen because we
_need_ the money, need it to do something that'll make a difference
for the whole world!"

% "We've got push space technology forward!"

Mercuriou: "Is the future here on Earth, Alister?  What do our leaders
want?  To drive technology forward?  Really?  Promote innovation?
Promote freedom? Is that why they've outlawed on-line libraries?  Is
that why they want a wall across our southern border?  Liberty?  Is
that what they call the drug war?"

Mercuriou: "They want to sell you gasoline, or video games, or stadium
tickets at prices people will grumble about and then pay while they
eat out every night and take their vacations on Maui.  We could have
video-on-demand, right now, I'm telling you!  We could take every
T.V. show aired in the last week and have it right there at the push
of a button!  We could take every book in the Library of Congress and
put it online for anyone in the world; we've _got_ that technology!
People in Cambodia could be building their own computers, but we keep
the designs secret while they sew our T-shirts.  The only innovation
our leaders want is innovation that they can control!"

Mercuriou: "So we need a revolution, and it's not going to happen in
this world; the establishment is too strong.  But out there..."

Mercuriou: "Think about it, Alister!  Grow your own food!  Make your
own power!  The asteroids are practically pre-mined!  If we find a
pure vein of gold, everyone will be copying this design to build their
own spaceships and race after us."

% "If not, we can still mine the minerals we need to build more ships.
% Silicon chip production should actually be easier in a vacuum!"

Mercuriou: "Six billion people on this people!  Think about it!
_Six_billion_ of us!  How many of them make a difference, really?  How
many of them get out of their easy chairs and change the world?  If
the human race is going into space, we've got to jump start it and
show the world that ordinary people can do it, not just seven colonels
and majors in a space shuttle!  And _to_hell_ with what our
great leaders here on Earth think about it!"

Mercuriou: "Picture yourself in a spacesuit, Alister!  Picture
yourself on the first manned mission to Mars!"

Mercuriou returned to the window and gazed out again over the ocean.
The steady rain had cooled the air and precipitated a dense fog that
rose from the sea and enveloped the land.  Beyond the edge of the
cliff there was only mist; the rhythmic sound of beating surf rose
from an unseen beach a hundred feet below.

Mercuriou: "...but it all sounds so crazy... too wild to be true!"

He turned and looked Alister straight in the eye.  The young man was
plastered back in his chair, his eyes riveted on Mercuriou.

Mercuriou: "I think you're intrigued, Alister!  So check out our
launch complex, and _then_ tell me what you think!"


T - 112 days    Christians must seem crazed

Burns: "Basically what we've done is to build a shell of carbon
molecules, what is called fullerene, and fill it with metallic
hydrogen, which is a very good rocket propellant but is only stable at
high pressure.  Either the metallic hydrogen needs a lot of external
pressure to hold it together, or a small ball of metallic hydrogen is
exerting tremendous outway pressure trying to fly apart, you can look
at it in either way.  We've kept the metallic hydrogen under high
pressure by filling it into a molecule of fullerene.  In fact, we need
two molecules of fullerene, one right inside the other, to maintain
the hydrogen under pressure."

Burns: "The net result is a rocket propellant that is liquid at room
temperature and a specific impulse of 1500 seconds, which is as good
as you get from a turbofan engine.  So you can build a rocket ship
that flies like an airplane."

[[
We've been promised this line of B.S.
before (the space shuttle) - it seems almost impossible to build a
rocket ship that flies like an airplane.  For one thing, he's ignoring
that the rocket ship has to achieve orbital velocity, which takes a
lot more energy, and a lot more fuel, than the airplane.
]]

The auditorium burst out into a resounding applause.  Once again, a
stellar team of American scientists, businessmen and engineers had
stuned the world with a brilliant new invention.  The bars on College
Avenue were packed with dot-com-ers glued to the live stream.

[[
College Avenue - scene two, remember?
]]

Near the back of the auditorium, Andrea Yeats had what she thought was
a far better seat than anyone in a fancy restaurant.  Next up was the
CEO, one Marcelius Mercuriou.

Mercuriou: "We're publishing everything we've got on N-1033.  We know
that we could make more money on it by locking down the patent rights,
but we believe in being a good corporate citizen!  I'm very grateful
to NASA; they have granted us a contract to manufacture N-1033 for the
American space flight program, but we're opening N-1033 to the world!"

Kyle: "So what'd you think?"

Kyle's Volkswagen zoomed down Interstate 45 toward the Johnson Spaceflight
Center.  The morning rush hour had passed, and an electronic sign over
the roadway advised, `NASA Road 1 -- 5 minutes'.

Andrea: "When I heard the learn'd astronomer..."

[[
Walt Whitman - Andrea is disdainful of the materialism of the whole
spaceflight program, the technological society in general.  She's
thinking that living on the farm is the better spiritual path.  She's
going to find out that following God, where ever that leads us,
is the true path, whether it leads to a farm or to Mars.
]]

Kyle: "Oh, come on, Andrea!  They're publishing the whole synthesis
pathway!  ...and disclaiming all the patent rights!  I thought you'd
love it!"

She thought over the entire press conference.  Some new rocket fuel,
no _revolutionary_ new rocket fuel, truly revolutionary.  What were
they calling the company?  TenTech?

[[
It was the 1033'th compound they'd tried in some way (probably
in simulation), so they call it ten-thirty and name the company
TenTech
]]

Andrea: "Kyle, I just get sick of all these guys who act real cool,
and wear blue jeans to work, and call everybody 'dude', and deep down
inside they're a bunch of bastards.  I'll bet you they've got some
kind of angle on this, just wait.  The engineer really knew his stuff,
but the CEO was a con artist."

Kyle: "Well, 1033's no con, Andrea!  TenTech's ramping up to full
production!  Terry and Steve are working on a new design; they're
talking about a shuttle without SRBs!  Maybe single stage to lunar
orbit!  I thought you'd be excited about this, I mean, this could
really mean people living in space!"

[[
Terry and Steve were my first bosses, along with Dave Rogers and
Bill McCracken, at my first job, at the US Naval Academy
]]

Andrea: "Kyle, we've got airplanes flying between all of our major
cities every day, and for most of the six billion people on this
planet, they might as well _be_ space shuttles.  Our problems are here
on Earth."

Kyle: "Well, I thought you'd be excited about this."

Andrea: "I didn't mean it like that.  I mean, if you want to do it...
I just know that _my_ problems are here on Earth.  I'm not blasting
off from the Cape again."

[[
No, she's not.  She'll blast off from Hawaii, even though she thinks
she's never going back to space.
]]

Kyle: "OK, well... OK."

Andrea: "Thanks for inviting me down, though; it's been too long since
we've seen each other!"

Kyle: "Next time take a plane, I'll pay for it; you give me such a
fright hitchhiking!"

Andrea: "You put your faith in God, Kyle...  and you tie your hair up
under a cap and lose the miniskirt!"

% Kyle: "A space suit, yes; a mini-skirt, never!"

Kyle pulled off I-45 and stopped at a city bus stop.  Andrea got out
and pulled her bag out of the trunk.

Kyle: "Sweetheart, you sure you don't want a plane?"  She shook her
head as he pulled out five twenty-dollar bills and handed them to her
along with a bus token.

Kyle: "Just this once take the Greyhound!"

Andrea: "Thanks, Kyle.  I love you."

Kyle: She hugged him, and he got back in the car before quietly
answering, "I love you too, girl," and then cried out "Call me when
you get home!" as he drove away.

It was ten o'clock in the morning.  Andrea climbed on a half empty
downtown local and gazed out the window as the controlled access
highway gave way to mid-market chain restaurants, landscaped malls,
downtown streets and finally the transfer station.
_What's_wrong_with_me_, she wondered.  Wasn't Kyle right?  Wasn't it
good of these men to disclaim the patent rights on their invention
instead of trying to monopolize it?  _Give_to_all_who_beg_of_you._
Wasn't it the Christian thing to do?  _Maybe_I'm_just_being_cynical_.

At the transfer station, instead of walking the three blocks to
Greyhound, she spent five minutes deciphering a wall of posted bus
schedules, then climbed onto another local headed into one of the
older sections of town, walking the last quarter mile to a
hundred-year-old Catholic church that occupied an entire city block.
Built of iron, stone, and glass, it could have been mistaken for a
prison except for the cross mounted on its steeple.  Walking around
back, she found a rear entrance sporting a colorful sign that read,
`The Franciscan Fryer'.

[[
This idea came from a modern, California-based Franciscan friar whom I
met years ago in Baja California and forgot his name.  The Franciscan order
sent him to culinary school and he came up with
this idea for a "Franciscan restaurant"
for a class presentation.  I "cooked up"
its name myself.
]]

Entering, she found herself in a tiled dining room set with
white plastic tables and metal chairs.  Three men were preparing for
lunch.  Hanging against the far wall was a rood icon cross, painted in
Byzantine style, with a red background and a bevy of saints behind the
figure of the crucified Messiah.  Andrea recognized it immediately --
the San Damiano Cross, replica of the crucifix which, eight hundred
years earlier, had spoken in a vision to the young man who knelt
before it in prayer near the Italian village of Assisi.

Bible: { "Now go hence, Francis, and build up my house, for it is nearly falling down!"

Francis had looked about him at the crumbling chapel he knelt in and
set out to do as the vision commanded.  Returning to his father's
shop, he took several rolls of fine cloth (without permission), rode
to a nearby market town, sold both cloth and horse, and returned to
the chapel, where he tried to press the money into the hands of a
very reluctant priest.  Andrea had always felt that it was a typical
message from God: simple, powerful, and very easy to misunderstand.

"We don't serve until eleven."

Andrea: "I'm looking for Brother Dunstan."

[[
I bestowed Dunstan with the persona of Dunstan Robidiuex, a Benedictine monk,
originally from the Toronto area,
at St. Anselm's Abbey in Washington, DC.
The forced Canadian-isms (eh?) are my own exaggerations.
]]

"Oh, he's probably in the kitchen."

She walked to the rear of the room, separated from the kitchen by a
long counter.  A pot-bellied man in his late forties, with
balding hair and a worn apron covering the brown habit of the
Franciscan order, muttered to himself as he stirred a steaming kettle
on the commercial stove that dominated the rear of the kitchen.

"Andrea!"

Andrea: "Hello, Dunstan!"

"Oh, Andrea!  What a joy it is to see you!"

Andrea: "Thanks, hey this place looks great!"

"Well, you know, I had somewhat different expectations for it.  I'd
wanted something more like a restaurant, you know, that would also
serve as a soup kitchen if people couldn't pay, but Andrea, we just
couldn't pay the rent downtown!"

Andrea: "That was the place on Travis Street?"

"Right!  I mean, a lot of people did pay, but usually only just enough
for their own food, you know, and then with those who didn't pay or
couldn't pay, well, we just couldn't afford to stay there.  It was a
nice location, but we just had to leave.  I prayed a lot, well I
worried a lot, and then this place turned up!  The rector here said we
could use the church's kitchen for free, and Andrea, it's been a real
blessing, because I try to keep the place open seven days a week, you
know, and on Sundays now so many people stay after church for lunch
that it's really helped the congregation, you know, their social life,
and I get regular donations now from them, and well, I just don't know
what I would have done without it!"

Andrea sat down as the workers finished setting up the room, and
Dunstan put the finishing touches on lunch, which they shared just as
the first customers, mostly homeless, came in.  The food, especially
considering its meager pretensions, was excellent.  There was fresh
baked bread, coffee and orange Tang ("the drink of astronauts!",
Dunstan toasted), a thick lentil soup with just enough tomatoes and
onions to give it depth, and tuna salad, replete with chopped Granny
Smith apples and stuffed into the fresh bread, one of Dunstan's
signature dishes.

"Can you stay until Sunday, I'm making stuffed peppers, you know, I
always like to do a nice lunch for the congregation?"

Andrea: "No, thanks, I'm heading back to my mom's place in Iowa today.
I just came down to visit Kyle Lankier, he has a new project, some
people have developed a new rocket fuel."

"You know, I heard about that!  They say it's quite revolutionary, is
that true?"

Andrea:  "Yes, it seems to be.  Kyle's quite excited about it."

"Well maybe we'll have one of our oblates flying back into space,
ehh?"

Andrea shook her head vigorously.

Andrea:  "No way, not a chance; I've made my last shuttle landing."

[[
Fact check: true.  She'll die about fifteen minutes before landing.
]]

As she was leaving, she quietly took one of the envelopes from a
holder on the table.  It was blank, except for a quote from the
Gospel of Matthew: 

Bible: { "When I was hungry, you fed me."

She fished the bus transfer slip out of her pocket and inspected it
closely.  It was still valid.  She put the rest of her money into the
envelope, sealed it, and slipped it into the drop box on her way out
the door.  Using the transfer to take a city bus to the northern
extremities of Houston, she walked another quarter mile to the
Interstate, sat down her duffel bag beside the ramp, and began
thumbing for a ride.

More than a hundred cars passed in about an hour before a cab stopped.
Andrea had almost not bothered to raise her thumb when she had seen
the distinctive yellow car. _Judge_not_by_appearances..._

"I'm only going about twenty miles to pick up a fare."

Those miles conveniently ended at an exit with a truck stop. She
didn't want to go into the restaurant, because she didn't want to
harass the truckers for a ride while they were eating, nor did she
want trouble with the management.  Instead, she fashioned a cardboard
sign reading "Iowa" and sat down with it between the parking area and
the on-ramp, making sure she could be seen from both.  Trucking
companies didn't like truckers giving out rides, but one of drivers
gave her a lift anyway.  He was going right through her state.

They talked through the afternoon as the miles drifted away.  He was
an aspiring writer who wanted to hear everything she could tell him
about NASA.  He was also a convicted hacker and was wearing a
monitoring bracelet on his ankle.  As dinner time approached, Andrea
explained a bit more about her religious order.

Andrea: "I appreciate the ride, and don't expect you to feed me just
because I gave all my money away.  I can fast until I get home.
Seriously."

"But you get everything by begging, right?"

Darren bought dinner at a diner in Oklahoma, during which Andrea
showed him a small plywood replica she kept of the San Damiano cross
and told him the story of St. Francis.

"So why did he give everything away?"

Andrea: "He was inspired by a Gospel quotation during mass: Do not
possess gold, nor silver, nor money in your purses.  This was two
years after the vision."

"How on earth did he live?"

Andrea: "Well, when he was rebuilding the church, he actually sang in
the marketplace and then asked his audience to donate stones.  The old
priest there would feed him dinner every night, but Francis didn't
want to impose on him, so he started taking a bowl and begging
door-to-door at dinner time.  By the time he ended his circuit through
Assisi, his bowl would be full, and that would be his dinner."

"So you go around town with a bowl!?"

Andrea: "No, I'm not as good a Franciscan as Francis was.  Nobody is.
What's happened to me is that I've found good friends and family to be
my surest supporters.  I don't travel as much as I should.  Maybe I'm
becoming a Benedictine."

...and then they talked on about how the Benedictine order favored
stability over the nomadic life, establishing monasteries and working
to maintain them rather than begging.  Later, Darren began squawking
into his C.B. radio as they approached the Iowa line.

"Got a rider here looking for a ride to Iowa Springs...  Any drivers
out there heading towards Iowa Springs?..."

[[
Once I had a truck driver get me a ride this way.

I tried it myself some years later and it didn't work so well for me.
]]

After nearly an hour of intermittent radio calls, driving closer to
Iowa all the time, he finally raised a truck delivering a load to a
silo only twenty miles from Andrea's family farm.  Andrea helped that
trucker navigate the back roads, called her mom for a ride from the
silo, and was home in bed by three o'clock in the morning.



T - 93 days    it must be sly

Burns: "_Technical_Sketch_One_?"

Mercuriou put his hands on his hips and stared at Burns.

Burns: "Well, that's how I think of it..."

Mercuriou: "Do you have an actual suggestion for the name of this vessel?"

[[
There's a double entendre on the word "vessel".  The spaceship
is the obvious "vessel", but the book can also be seen as a
"vessel" for the ideas contained within.  Mercuriou is the
only one trying to name the spaceship; everyone else is
suggesting names for the book, thus it is "sly".
]]

They stood at the base of a 767 airliner, its jet engines replaced
with rockets, its doors welded shut, a hydraulic mating adapter on its
nose.  Its avionics had been re-programmed to feature an orbital mode
of navigation, carbon dioxide scrubbers had been retrofitted into its
air conditioning system, and the rear half of the passenger cabin had
been sealed off and converted into an extra fuel tank.  It now sat
parked in a hanger adjacent to their private runway, on a cliff
overlooking the Pacific Ocean.

Burns: "_Manifesto_of_the_Secessionist_Party_?"

Mercuriou rolled his eyes, then turned to the ship's doctor.

[[
That wouldn't be a bad name for an aircraft carrier.
]]

Mercuriou: "Vic, please..."

Vic: "How about
_On_The_Evil_of_Capitalism_and_The_Danger_of_Democracy_?"

Mercuriou: Mercuriou now physically shook. "You want me to put
_that_... _there_!" he exclaimed as he waved toward the ship's
cockpit.  They all studied the spot thoughtfully.

Burns: "Something shorter would be better."

Vic: "_The_Great_Hawaiian_..."

Vic's voice died off as he groped for a fourth word.

Mercuriou: "_The_Great_Hawaiian_WHAT?_"

[[
Presumably, The Great Hawaiian Novel, but that's a name
for the book, not the spaceship.
]]

Vic shook his head and finally just shrugged.

Alister: "_Icarus_Wing_!"

Mercuriou: "What?"

Alister: "You heard me."

[[
In Greek mythology, Icarus was the son of Daedalus, who was killed
during an escape attempt from Crete, using wings made of 
feathers and wax.  He flew too close to the Sun and the
heat melted the wax in his wings.
]]

In the year and half since the South African had joined the crew,
Mercuriou had grown accustomed to his youthful outbursts, but nothing
had prepared him for this.  Icarus was a fictional character from
Greek mythology, who had escaped from the island fortress of Crete
using wings that his father Daedalus crafted from bird's feathers and
wax.  Daedalus survived the flight, but Icarus flew too close to the
sun, the wax melted, and he fell into the sea and perished.

Vic: "It doesn't even make sense grammatically."

Alister: "So?  Why does everything have to make sense?"

Mercuriou stared at the Afrikaner in disbelief.

Mercuriou: "You know who Icarus was?"

Alister: "Yeah."

Mercuriou: "Like hell we're naming it _Icarus_Wing_!  We're naming it
_Xplorer_One_!"


T - 7 days    friendship must be paid for

Kyle: "I'm inclined to say the thing looks like a front operation, but that
doesn't make any sense, either."

Sitting in the shade of her mother's porch, with a pitcher of iced
limeade on the table and two glasses half consumed, Andrea read
a stack of papers in silence.

Kyle: "You were right about Mercuriou, too.  I don't believe a word that
comes out of the man's mouth anymore.  I just can't figure out his angle."

Andrea: "There's no question that this stuff works."

Kyle: "None!  That's what doesn't make sense!  They're always having
production problems; they need more time."

Andrea: "No way.  Not with the quantities of nitric acid they're
consuming.  They've already been shipped enough to fuel about three
conventional shuttle launches."

Kyle: "And why are they doing all this in Hawaii... why?"

Andrea: "Sounds like you need a detective, Kyle."

Kyle: "I need somebody who can't get blown off by a bunch of techno-babble!"

Andrea: "What are you getting me roped into?"

He looked deflated.  Andrea sighed.
_Give_to_all_those_who_beg_of_you_...  especially your best friend!

Andrea: "All right. I'll go."

Kyle: "Great!  Listen, I've got everything set up; I'll pay for the plane
ticket and advance you a thousand dollars.  Their main facility is at
a place called South Point..."


T - 2 days    heroes must act like bums

Thirty thousand feet over the Pacific Ocean, the inter-island jet
darted across 'Alenuih\=ah\=a Channel, swept down Hawaii's leeward
coast, grazed Keahole Point at two thousand feet and touched down at
Kona International Airport amid a broken jumble of blackened lava
flows.  Unlike Honolulu's congested and dilapidated air hub, Kona was
more a collection of stone huts than anything bearing the grandiose
title ``International Airport''.  As the ground crew pushed a ramp up
to the plane (there was no jetway), the passenger in window seat 8A
stared morosely at an ATM card.

[[
This is pretty much my trip to the Big Island to research
the novel, when I was living on Oahu.
I didn't destroy my ATM card, but I did stash
it away to experience the island as Andrea might.

Afterwards I travelled on to Hilo and actually used the ATM
card to spend a night in the youth hostel mentioned in the
novel's final chapter.

about it." _...in_no_manner_are_they_to_receive_coins_or_money_..._

The allusion is to Andrew van der Bijl, aka Brother Andrew.  In his biography
_God's_Smuggler_, he talks lot about the Royal Way.

This allusion appears repeatedly in this chapter.  I even
put an extended quote in later in the novel.
]]

Andrea: "Excuse me, can you tell me how to get to South Point?"

"You can catch the Hele-On there in front of the space center."

The space center?  Indeed.  After the Challenger disaster, Hawaii had
built the Astronaut Ellison S. Onizuka Space Center to commemorate the
life and loss of one of her most prominent citizens.  The small white
building was closed when Andrea walked up to it, so she merely peered
through its windows and set down her backpack to wait for the bus.
Experience told her that bus drivers would sometimes give free rides
to the destitute, and that other passengers might assist when drivers
were unwilling.

No such finagling was necessary.  The Hele-On was a free service
operated by Hawaii county, so Andrea took a seat, cracked open a
window, and enjoyed the ride as the bus meandered past shopping
malls, more broken lava, seaside villages, beach parks, a high
school campus, an elevated tennis court and over every rise and around
every corner, the ocean, the ocean, the ocean.  The empty bus soon
filled with an assortment of locals heading home, and the driver even
waited for one passenger to mount a bicycle on a rack before boarding.
An intermittent drizzle began to fall as Kona's rich volcanic soil
gave way to the rolling forested hills on Mauna Loa's southern flank.

Dusk was falling two hours later when Andrea disembarked at the road
leading to South Point.  Few riders were left on the departing bus;
most had gotten off at a park-and-ride a few miles back.  There was
little to remark upon except a road sign and an abandoned building,
which Andrea immediately seized upon as a Godsend.  A quick
investigation of its contents revealed a detachable bench seat that
would serve as a small but usable bed, and several scraps of carpet
that could be passably used as blankets.  Weeds were growing up
through the floorboards, while liquor bottles and graffiti bore mute
witness to the transients that, like her, occasionally livened the
old building for a few hours.

Yet was this The Royal Way?  It hardly seemed fit for a queen, but
then neither had Christ's crown, nor had his throne.  Andrea took one
of the carpets, walked back across the road, wrapped it around her,
and sat down to see if anyone would take pity and give her a ride.
Several cars passed, but none stopped.  After half an hour, the rain
began to fall again, so Andrea returned to the old building and
settled in for the night.

Perhaps here, in this world, this _was_ The Royal Way.


T - 1 day    danger must appear innocent

It had rained off and on throughout the night, but the old building's
roof was solid and the carpets had cut enough of the chill to allow at
least a few hours of sleep.  Now, shortly after dawn, Andrea packed
her bag, straightened up the ramshackle furniture, and walked out to
the road, where a young couple was waiting for the bus.

"Do you know what time it is?"

She fished her cellphone out of her pack long enough to check.

Andrea: "Seven-thirty."

They reacted with disappointment.  The Hele-On was a free service, but
ran only once or twice a day, and they were waiting for a 7 AM bus.
Andrea wished them luck and set off on what she thought was the last
leg of her journey.

Edged by low stone walls on either side, the lonely asphalt road
meandered south though a forest interspersed with orchards and citrus
farms.  She sipped some water from a rusty basin on the side of the
road.  After an hour of walking, fatigue and doubt began to conspire
against her.

_This_is_stupid._

_I_look_like_a_bum_not_an_engineer._

_I_can't_function_in_this_society._

_How_long_is_this_road?_

_He_might_have_to_come_out_to_Hawaii_to_get_me,_maybe_he_can_hold_my_
_hand_through_this_...

_You_need_him_to_hold_your_hand?_

As the tears rolled down her face, she looked skyward and
implored God.

Andrea: "Why am I here?  This is stupid!  This is all because I
decided to do some stupid favor for money."

No answer came back from
the heavens, only the mid-morning sun blazing down from the sky.  The
silence encouraged her to speak loudly and openly to the deity,
something she rarely did in the crowded city.  She fell on her knees
in the middle of the road.

Andrea: "I'm sorry; I'm sorry!  I thought this was the right thing to do!
Now, please God, how do I get out of this without losing Kyle's
money?"

Physically and emotionally exhausted, she sat down right there, cried
steadily for several minutes, then took stock of her situation.  Her
jeans were ripped from where they had snagged on a nail, her right
side was covered in dirt from the carpets, her hair was matted with
dried sweat, and she had slept in her clothes.

_This_is_stupid_.  _I_am_NOT_OK_.  _I'm_filthy_and_exhausted_,
_and_I_can't_show_up_looking_like_this_.

_No_dumb_fuel_problem_is_worth_this_...

_That's_what_I'll_tell_Kyle_...

_No_dumb_fuel_problem_is_worth_this_...

_That's_what_I'll_tell_Kyle_...

She was awake before the car stopped.

Two men were seated in the car, both dressed for the endless Hawaiian
summer in shorts, T-shirts, and sunglasses.  The man in the passenger
seat was talking on a cellphone and completely ignored her.  The
driver, a friendly fellow in his early twenties, got out and asked her in a funny
Australian accent if she needed help, and she mumbled something about
heading back into town.  He offered her a ride, so she climbed into the back seat, and they
drove on back up the road.  The passenger waved them both silent.

Mercuriou: "No, no, no, we've got plenty of 1033.  We've got tanks and
tanks full of it.  You can come see that for yourself.  We just have
to get the export paperwork taken care of.  It's just a delay."

Mercuriou: "Of course it works!  You have the samples, don't you?"

Mercuriou: "Well, then make it yourself!  We can pay for the
spacesuits in cash."

Mercuriou: "I will need time to find another buyer."

Mercuriou: "I know I just said that, but you said we could pay in fuel..."

Mercuriou: "Just let me handle it.  I'll make it work.  I promise."

%\selectlanguage{russian}
Mercuriou: "Cpacebo.  Cpacebo.  Do cbidaniy."
%\selectlanguage{english}

The passenger clicked the cellphone off, then punched some more
buttons on it.  While Andrea slowly digested what she had heard, he
made another call.

Mercuriou: "Yeah, what's up?"

Mercuriou: "Well, if he doesn't show, he doesn't show."

Mercuriou: "A woman?"

Without disconnecting or even lowering the cell phone, he slowly
turned around in his seat, looking at her almost as if seeing her now
for the first time.

Mercuriou: "I'm sorry, ummm, we weren't really introduced..."

Andrea decided that this would be a good time to produce
her government credentials, and she did so.

Andrea: "Andrea Yeats.  I'm with NASA."

At various times, Andrea had seen people red-faced with excitement,
hysteria, and embarrassment, but now, for the first time in her life,
she actually watched someone's face as it turned red.  The flush began
just above Mercuriou's cheekbones, then, in a split second, spread to
his cheeks, his forehead, and then ran across his entire face.  He
clenched his teeth and turned back around in his chair.

Mercuriou: "I'll get back to you," he told Vic in a clipped voice,
severed the connection without waiting for an answer, took the
earpiece out of his ear, wound its cord around the telephone and put
it down on the dashboard.  For a moment they drove on in silence.

Mercuriou: "Turn around," Mercuriou quietly told Alister.

Andrea: "Look, I'm heading into town, I can just walk back..."

Mercuriou: "You're not going anywhere," Mercuriou interrupted as he
unclipped his seat belt, turned fully around in his chair, and revealed
the semiautomatic pistol he had covertly retrieved from its holster under his seat.

Alister brought the car to a stop, then looked back and forth between
his two passengers with a pained expression on his face.  Meanwhile,
Andrea slowly realized that she was being kidnapped.

Mercuriou: "Turn around.  Go back."

Within sight of the highway, Alister executed a three-point turn and
headed back down the road.  Again past the stone walls, the orchards
and farms, past her break-down spot, they drove on as the forest gave
way to broad meadows framed on three sides by hundred foot cliffs and
the Pacific Ocean beyond.  They passed through an automatic gate,
crossed a runway that stretched fully from one side of the point to
the other, and drove past a hanger into a complex of low buildings.

[[
It's South Point, but the automatic gate and the entire secret
base are contrived.

At one point, there was a landing strip at South Point,
just as described, but it was closed years ago and
all that remains is a rectangular clearing.
]]

They walked into a large room whose walls were lined with whiteboards
hung over cluttered office tables amid a jumble of cardboard boxes and
packing material.  Andrea walked willingly, partly out of curiosity,
partly because there was simply no other place else to go.  She never
thought of running.  Burns was there, sporting a black T-shirt that
read simply "CAPITALISM SUCKS", as was Vic, who looked up from a
notepad as they came in.

Vic: "The man who called was named Kyle Lankier..."

His voice drifted off when he saw Andrea and an awkward pause ensued.
Mercuriou turned around.

Mercuriou: "Doctor Yeats... during the ride here... I was trying to
decide, umm... exactly..."

Andrea: "What you're going to do with me?"

Mercuriou: "Precisely."

Vic: "What's going on?  What happened?" Vic asked, the second question
addressed to Alister as if expecting an explanation from him.

The young man opened his mouth as if to speak, but couldn't quite
explain how he had picked up a woman seated crying in the middle of
the road, or how Mercuriou had continued his imprudent cellphone
conversation, or how they had discovered the true identity of their
passenger.  Finally, after a second or two, he just shrugged his
shoulders and closed his mouth without saying a word.

Andrea: "I believe the colloquial expression is that I 'know too
much'."

Mercuriou: "Um-hum," Mercuriou responded, nodding in agreement before
turning towards Burns.

Mercuriou: "The old server room, can you rig the door so it can't be
opened from the inside?"

The engineer leaned back in his chair and nodded slowly.

Vic: "What are you thinking, Marc?" Vic asked with concern in his
voice.  The only reply was a raised palm.

Burns: "Yeah... the locking mechanism is in the wall, so I could weld
the door handle in place, along with the bolt.  You'd need a card key
to open it from the outside, and you couldn't open it at all from the
inside..."

Mercuriou: "Fine. Do it."

Vic: "Now, wait a minute, Marc, you're talking about kidnapping now."

Mercuriou: "Vic, we will have this discussion later."

Vic: "No, we won't have it later..."

Andrea: "He's not talking about it, he's done it... Vic."

Mercuriou: "Vic!  We will have this discussion later!  We will have
this discussion _when_Dr._Yeats_is_not_in_this_room_.  OK?  Now,
_please_, let's just get all the loose stuff out of that room while I
stay here with the doctor."

The other three men looked slowly at one another.  None of them liked
what they were being asked, no, told to do, but Burns got up and led
Alister down a hallway, leaving Andrea, Marc and Vic to eye each other
in silence, she sitting on a chair in the middle of the room, the
captain perched on a tabletop with his pistol still in his hand, and
Vic still seated in his chair.  Twenty minutes later, the concierge
returned to announce that the room was ready.  Mercuriou escorted the
NASA engineer down a hallway and around a corner to a windowless
forty-by-one-hundred-foot room populated solely by a rectangular grid
of floor-to-ceiling black steel frames.  Upon entering, Andrea turned
back to face Mercuriou.

Andrea: "Don't I get some fancy explanation of what you're up to?"

Mercuriou: "No," he answered, then closed the door behind him, insured
that it was locked, and began to walk away.

Andrea: "Mr. Mercuriou," she called through the wall, "I'm sure we can
discuss..."

The card key flashed through the lock with such a swoosh that Andrea
took an involuntary step back from the door, then another as it was
pushed open.

Mercuriou: "Captain Mercuriou, it's _Captain_ Mercuriou!"

...and he was gone.


Launch Day    it must be funny

Vic: "No, Marc, no, absolutely NO!"

Mercuriou: "Three days, Vic, that's all we need -- three days!  Burns
wants a week, but I'm compromising on three days!"

Vic: "You're not compromising on a damn thing, Marc!  You're talking
about holding someone prisoner -- an innocent person -- for days!
You've already held her captive for a night!"

Mercuriou: "It has to done, Vic!  It just has to be done, and we're
not arguing about it!  Alister!"

Vic: "Yes, we are arguing about it, Marc!"

Mercuriou: "Alister!  Get an MRE and a bottle of water and give it to
Dr. Yates!  Dammit, Vic, don't fight me on this!"

Vic: "Marc, you can't do this, you just can't!"

Andrea had woken early in the darkened room.  She had no watch, and
there were no windows, but it had _felt_ like morning.  At least she
seemed rested.  She sat up against the wall and began to pray,
starting with the Lord's Prayer.  Softly, just barely audibly, she
repeated it three times, each more slowly than the last, contemplating
the words more deeply each time.

_Thy_will_be_done._ _Am_I_here_for_a_reason,_Lord?_  _For_your_reason?_

_...as_we_forgive_those_who_trespass_against_us..._
_...if_someone_forces_you_into_service_to_walk_a_mile_, _walk_two_...
_I_forgive_these_people_here_, Lord, _they're_almost_comical_

As she did so often, she returned to Christ's prayer in the garden,
"not my will, Father, but thine."  _Not_my_will,_Lord_,
_if_you_have_some_reason_for_me_to_be_here_, _and_you_must_,
_thy_will_be_done_, Lord, _thy_will_, _not_mine_, _thine_.

She sat still, practicing a Buddhist exercise that she had learned at
a class and adopted for Christian use.  She focused on her breath, in
and out through her nostrils.  She tried to clear her mind of her own
thought and cast it upward, trying to enter a calm state where she
could, just maybe, like Elijah in the cave, hear the still, quiet
voice of God.  When she got caught up in her own imagination, she
re-focused on her breath and tried to calm her mind again.

She didn't do a very good job.  In fact, she never did a very good
job.  Meditation was the hardest thing that she had ever attempted,
far more difficult than executing some suited procedure that she had
practiced a hundred times in a water tank on the ground.  Her mind
kept racing back to her present situation, all the craziness of the
last two days, _why_didn't_she_run_?,
_what_do_they_want_with_spacesuits_?, _breath_in_, _breath_out_,
_breath_in_, _breath_out_.

At least she resolved upon a plan, if you could call it that.  She
waited quietly until the electronic lock clicked and the door was
cautiously pushed open.  It was the blond-haired youth with the
foreign accent.

Alister: "Sorry... I brought you some breakfast!" he announced as
cheerily as he could muster, putting a bottle of water and a military
ration down on the floor next to the door.

Andrea: "Do you think I could use the bathroom?" Andrea asked,
standing up and pushing her hair back.  He seemed indecisive, and
didn't answer at first.

Andrea: "Look, I'm covered in dirt; I haven't bathed in two days;
I've slept in my clothes for two nights; I'd like to at least splash
some water on my face and go to the toilet."

There was no need to lie.  It was all true.

Alister: "OK... uh, sure, it's right down the hall," he answered,
before leading the way about a hundred feet to a restroom.

Alister: "I'll wait here," he mumbled.

Once inside, she turned on a water faucet and immediately started
searching for a way out.  The room had no windows but was covered with
a ceiling of drop panels.  Climbing onto the back of a toilet, she
could reach the ceiling and push one of the ceiling panels aside.  She
started to scramble up, but saw that the wall continued straight up to
another ceiling several feet above the panels.

Andrea: "Shoots!" she muttered to herself, then climbed down and went
to the other side of the room.  The sinks might not be strong enough
to support her weight.  Returning to the toilet, she realized that she
could just reach a large, circular pipe above the panel ceiling.
Climbing up again and grabbing it, she pulled herself up and found
herself crouched in a dark, dusty space between the two ceilings.  In
the dim light, she could make out the course of the wall down to where
it met the hallway.  In the other direction, the crawl space seemed to
extend beyond the bathroom wall, so she clambered along the pipe in
that direction, picking her way around cables and pipes as she went.
Once past the bathroom, she opened one of the ceiling panels below,
swung her legs down into it, and dropped down into the sunlit room
below, slipping, grabbing the ceiling, and bringing part of it
crashing down with her.

There were chairs, a desk, books, a drafting table covered with
papers.  She picked up the telephone handset on the desk, then stopped
to look at the books on celestial mechanics, materials science and
rocket propulsion.  She put down the phone and walked over to the
drafting table.  _Spain_never_designed_a_rocket_engine_.
_They_aren't_selling_fuel_; _they're_hoarding_it_.
_They_need_spacesuits_,_too._

Mercuriou: "Vic, we are not arguing about this!  This is a command decision!"

Vic: "I will not accept this.  I will not accept this."

Mercuriou: "I am in command of this mission!  I am giving an order!"

Vic: "Give your order, Marc, I'll go to police right now!  I'll pick
up that phone myself!  I mean it!"

Mercuriou: "Vic, if you pick up that phone,
I'll... I'll... I'll... What!!!?"

Alister: "It's Dr. Yates, she's still in the bathroom, and I heard a
noise..."

Mercuriou marched down the hallway and announced his presence.

Mercuriou: "Coming in, professor, pull up your pants!"

Broken from her reverie, Andrea snatched up the phone once more and
dialed, listening to the noises in the next room as it rang in Houston.

Andrea: "Kyle, it's Andrea!"

Kyle: "My God, girl, where are you?"

Andrea: "I'm at TenTech; they've kidnapped me and are holding me
prisoner here!"

Kyle: "What?!"

Andrea: "Look, they've got a launch on!"

Kyle: "What kind of launch?"

Andrea: "Manned.  They have spacesuits..."

She paused, remembering something odd about the storage tanks they had
drove past on the way in.  Their fire diamonds displayed red threes,
indicating strong flammability danger, yet the notice code was
``OX''... oxidizer... nitric acid...

Andrea: "...and forget three shuttle launches;
they've got enough fuel here for three hundred!"

The door's electronic lock clicked and Andrea dropped the phone, threw
the chair through the window and leaped through after it before
Mercuriou could circumnavigate the desk.  _They've_got_guns!_
_They've_got_guns_! Running up the road, she began to calm down as she
reached the runway.  _So_what_if_they_do?_ She slowed down and finally
stopped completely as she reached the automatic gate.
_Where_are_they?_

They were glued to a webcam of the highway junction, relying images of
a half dozen police squad cars peeling off to the south in response to
a kidnapping report.

Mercuriou: "OK, our launch clock's at zero...  Let's get to the ship!"

All four of them dashed out of the building and piled in the Jeep.
Alister gunned it up the road to the hanger, where they found Yeats
inspecting the exterior of _Xplorer_One_.

Andrea: "This is quite a rocket ship you've got here."

Mercuriou motioned his crew towards the access platform.

Andrea: "You have some kind of launch planned?"

Mercuriou: "Why don't you just get lost?  Haven't you caused enough
trouble today?"

Mercuriou followed his crew up the metal staircase to the airlock
while Andrea followed him.  _A_private_manned_launch_.  For the first
time since Kyle had talked her into this, she actually wanted to
laugh.  _THIS_I_have_GOT_to_see_.

Mercuriou had reached the hatch, climbed inside, and turned
around, ready to close it.

Mercuriou: "Well, Doctor, you can go now.  Sorry for
your detention..."  he began, but never finished, because Andrea
grabbed the rim of the hatch, swung her feet up, and kicked him
squarely in the chest.

Andrea: "Captain Mercuriou!  _Captain_ Mercuriou!"  she hollered,
clambering in behind.

Vic: "What's going on?" Vic called from the cabin.

Andrea: "It's Captain Mercuriou!  He fell!"

Mercuriou flew to his feet, so enraged that he half-hallucinated four
men with red shirts and black pants, already moving to seize the
intruder and awaiting only his order to throw her out.  He blinked and
they were gone.

[[
In the _Star_Trek_ T.V. shows and movies, the security officers
always wear red shirts and black pants.
]]

Andrea: "Do you want the hatch closed now?  Is that your next order... _sir_?"

Mercuriou gritted his teeth and snarled through them.

Mercuriou: "You don't what you getting into, lady."

Andrea: "Then clue me in."

Mercuriou: They locked eyes for a moment, then Mercuriou pressed his
face within six inches of hers and hissed "Mars!"

Andrea: "That's great; I've always wanted to go to Mars!  Now, you
might need an experienced astronaut; I've had three weeks on orbit.
You've got suits; I hope you've got motion sickness drugs..."

He tried to interrupt, but she shushed him.

Andrea: "...but first, you've got to _get_ into orbit, and that I've
_got_ to see!"

[[
Why does she so impulsively jump on board?

It's a snap decision, of course, but she sees a bunch of amateurs
trying to do something dangerous, and it's something she knows well - manned space flight.

Perhaps she should come to regret this, 
]]

Alister: "Here come the k\^erels!"

[[
Some afrikans word for the po-po.  I hope.

]]

Mercuriou: "Burns, start the engines!" Mercuriou yelled, then turned
back to Andrea.

Mercuriou: "OK, this is it, this is it, I'm not kidnapping you
-- Vic you are my witness! -- I'm not forcing you, but you get out
now, I'm telling you we're not coming back for a long long time, I say
get out right now, or you're in this for good, and I mean for good!"

The two rocket engines roared to life and the ship began to tremble.
Andrea felt like she had when she picked up Dunstan in the rain, when
she wrote 'math class' on the auction form, when she decided to quit
NASA.  She nodded her head.

[[
Presumably, these are times in her life when she's made decisions
that turned out well.  Maybe picking up a man walking in a
rainstorm was the first time she met her friend Dunstan.
Maybe offering a "math class" in some kind of charity auction
led to a productive tutoring relationship.
]]

_Xplorer_One_ sped down the runway as police cars swarmed the complex.
Some of the policemen watched with their months agape, deafened by the
roaring engines and stunned by the sight of a jumbo jet belching
rocket exhaust as it lurched off the cliff, dipped perilously close to
the ocean a hundred feet below, then gained speed and climbed to ten
thousand feet.

Burns: "Launch cargo!"

Alister keyed a command sequence on his computer.  From camouflaged
launchers in the forest below, first one rocket thundered aloft, then
another, and another.

Alister: "Three all-green; four launching!" Alister called out from
his computer monitor, while Vic and Mercuriou were arguing again.

Mercuriou: "She doesn't really need a spacesuit," Mercuriou tried.

Vic: "She most certainly does need a spacesuit, Marc.  We have spares
in cargo, but what happens if we lose cabin pressure before then?"

Mercuriou was silent for a moment.  Only Alister's voice was heard.

Alister: "Seventeen's up; sixteen just went inertial; eighteen launching!"

A panic seized the nearby towns as missile after missile streaked
skyward; many thought the nation had gone to war with Libya.

[[
Why Libya?

On July 4, 1985, an epic baseball game in Atlanta ended at
4 am the next morning, at which point the stadium crew
fired off the scheduled Independence Day fireworks celebration.
According to 

https://www.parkerpioneer.net/sports/article_6f562562-9dde-11e9-b8de-c3c24e49dd81.html

the police were called asking if the city had been bombed.

I think I read somewhere that at least one person thought
the city was being attacked by Libya, but now I can't
find a reference to that.

My first reaction to reading this was to ridicule these
Americans as fools.  How could Libya possibly attack
Atlanta?  The Reagan administration had a big hyped-up
confrontation with Libya, whose government was accused
of trying to get nuclear weapons, supporting terrorism,
and claiming more than their territorial limit, so
people just fit events
into the reality projected on T.V., no matter
how absurd the conclusion.

But after 9/11 happened, I reconsidered.  Foreign states
are more capable of striking America than I had given
them credit for, and Libyian agents had already bombed both
Rome and Berlin.

Given the timeline of the novel, Iraq would make more sense.

What would people, think, really?  Seeing rocket after rocket
streaking into the sky, I think I'd assume that it was our
military launching them, and that we'd gone to war not
with Libya or Iraq, but Russia or China.
]]

Vic: "We have to abort the mission."

Mercuriou: "We are not aborting this mission!"

Andrea: "I'm fine; I'll take the chance."

Vic: "No, you are not fine!  I am the ship's doctor, and I'm telling
you, Marc, we have to abort this mission because we have an untested
ship and _she_could_get_killed_ if we lose cabin pressure."

Alister: "Nine just acquired LEO; thirty-four launching."

[[
This is a bit unrealistic.  If a series of rockets really took
this long to launch, the rotational motion of the planet would
scatter them all over LEO.
]]

Burns_Mercuriou_Burns: Burns turned to Mercuriou from the pilot's
seat, "Marc!".  "What?"  "We need to _leave_!  What if the Air Force shows up?"

Mercuriou: "Let her take mine."

Vic: "No, she can't take yours, because then _you_ won't have a spacesuit."

Mercuriou: "OK, so then I'll die and you'll be rid of me and you can
do whatever you want!  Look, Vic, we can't go back!  If we go back, we
go to jail!  I'll take my chances with death!"

Vic relented.  Death over jail, that he understood.  Andrea got the
spacesuit.

Mercuriou: "How do we look, Burns?"

Burns: "We've got clean launches on the first fifty-one
cargo rockets... make that fifty-two; everything's fine."

As soon as Andrea was suited and seated, Burns put the plane into a
near vertical climb.  It wasn't the most optimal launch profile, but
the aircraft wasn't designed for supersonic flight, so Burns made sure
that he climbed above the atmosphere before beginning a true orbital
insertion.  As they passed fifty miles in altitude, he nudged forward
on the joystick, the engines pivoted, and the giant blue ball of the
Pacific Ocean swung up below them.  They were now above most of the
atmosphere, and Burns began their insertion burn proper, firing the
engines continuously for nearly ten minutes, then cutting them off and
letting the ship coast.  Finally, he fired the engines again for
several minutes more to stabilize their orbit.

[[
A more conventional manned space launch would go supersonic very quickly,
usually about a minute after launch.  Rockets are more efficient
at higher speeds, so you want to get going as quickly as possible,
as fast as possible, but not so fast as to crush your human occupants.  A constant
two-gee force (one-gee gravity and one-gee rocket acceleration)
will get you supersonic in about thirty seconds, so that's
about the shortest practical time.

The suggestion here is that since the 767 can't go supersonic
in the atmosphere
due to its structural design limits, we can compensate by
flying slower until we're above the atmosphere.  This uses more
fuel, but the entire plot suggests that their fuel
supply is unlimited.
]]

On Earth, confusion reigned.  Cable news channels reported the last
several cargo launches live, and speculation was rampant that the
missiles contained some kind of chemical or biological agent.  Around
the world, TV networks began interrupting their regular programming to
cover the event, showing graphical ground tracks of the orbiting cargo
modules and warning people as they drifted above.  The U.S. State
Department was fielding a barrage of queries from foreign embassies
anxious to know what was happening.  The President abandoned a trip to
Europe and turned Air Force One back towards the capital.  Once there,
he held a hurried meeting of his national security team, finally
blowing up in frustration, throwing a briefing folder and sending Top
Secret papers flying.

"Why the hell do I have find out from CNN when 170 missiles get fired
off in Naale-Naale-...whatever-the-hell!"

[[
Naalehu is one of the southernmost towns in the U.S.,
not far from South Point.
]]

That evening, the President addressed a rapt but unshaken nation,
refining the news that the networks had been reporting for hours.  A
renegade group of entrepreneurs, under investigation for wire fraud
and kidnapping, had somehow managed to execute the first private
manned space launch.  After reassuring the public that the government
was carefully tracking the situation, the President correctly
identified the four principle suspects, then took three questions.
When asked if he was pursuing a diplomatic solution to the crisis, the
President replied only that attempts were being made to contact the
perpetrators.  When asked if a military response was being considered,
the President replied that the military always stood ready to defend
the nation, but it was not yet clear if an attack was imminent.  When
asked if the U.S. military was capable of striking a target in orbit,
the President had no comment on U.S. military capabilities.

In Houston, Kyle Lankier watched the press conference alone and in
silence.

Andrea Yeats was never mentioned.


T + 1 day    long political rants must be interspersed throughout

Andrea: "Excuse me?  What are you doing?"

Mercuriou had hollered since launch to get lined up with the cargo
modules.  They assembled them together by matching orbits, docking
their nose, then re-positioning them into a higher orbit, connecting
them together as they went.  They collected first module A-1 Captain's
Quarters and then attached module A-1-1 Captain's Storage.  Mercuriou
then halted the entire operation to dock with A-1 Captain's Quarters,
equalize pressure, and disappear inside.

Mercuriou: "I'm working on my speech for this evening, Dr. Yates.  It
must be delivered live in American prime time.  I wish I had longer to
prepare, but your stunt disrupted my timing.  Now please leave me
alone."

Andrea mumbled a reply into the closing hatch.

Andrea: "You know, there's really a lot of work to be done with the cargo
modules..."

The hatch flew back open.

Mercuriou: "Dr. Yeats, my speeches are the most important cargo this
vessel carries!"

[[
Again, the same double entendre on "vessel" that I used earlier.
If the "vessel" is the book itself, then yes, his speeches
are a very important part of it.  Toss in his ego, and
they become its most important part.
]]

News of the rocket launch had galvanized the world, or at least
everyone in the world, or at least everyone in the Most Important
Country In The World.  Now came live pictures of a man floating in
zero-gee, in a manner quite unprecedented.

[[
The United States of America, of course.
]]

Red banners festooned A-1's rear wall, and hid the access hatch to
A-1-1 behind them.  Two vertical Roman lances impaled with globes of
Mars rose on either side of a desk, behind which Mercuriou now
appeared seated with a tablet computer in front on him, dressed in a
crisp white uniform as might be worn by a cruise ship captain.  The
rest of the crew watched from behind the camera.

Mercuriou: "Good evening.  My name is Marcelius Mercuriou, and I am
the captain of the spaceship _Xplorer_One_.  Most people call me Marc.
Some people call me Sir."

[[
One of my high school classmates is Mark Mercules (check that spelling).
I got the Captain's name by morphing his around a bit.
]]

Mercuriou: "I and my compatriots have today launched a bold new
venture.  We intend nothing less than to begin the colonization of our
Solar System!  We do this not so much because we wish to, but because
we must!  We can not wait around and let our planet be destroyed while
some cynical group of global manipulators push everyone to 'compete'!
We much protect our freedom; we must safeguard our independence!  Like
the pioneers who set out across America's wilderness 300 years ago, we
know that the path forward into uncharted lands is fraught with danger
and discomfort, yet it is the only way forward."

Mercuriou: "We do this because America is committed to enslaving the
world, and her only condition is that the chain be fashioned from
gold.  Your choices under capitalism are to become a capitalist, or to
work for them, or to be thrown homeless on the streets.  Becoming a
capitalist means becoming a cynical, indifferent bastard who stands
behind a counter, shrugs his shoulder if you don't have money, and
tells you to get a job."

[[
Alexander Hamilton, in a letter to a friend, wrote that America
wanted slavery, and her only condition was the chain be fashioned from gold.
]]

Mercuriou: "Such people are, of course, hated.  Many of us bitterly
resent their rule; why else would phrases like 'Love It Or Leave It'
have become part of our national lexicon?"

Mercuriou: "So I have decided to Get The Hell Out!  Why not?  We know
what kind of leadership America has.  It's not going to change.  Why
would it?  It's what The People want.  It's just not what _I_ want."

[[
I really do think he makes good speeches.  They don't make too much
sense, but they sound good and that's what's important.

There's another double entendre.
Sounding good is important for both authors and politicians.
]]

Mercuriou: "I am declaring tonight the Republic of Mars.  Let me
inculcate some of our principles, starting with freedom of speech.
Unlike capitalists, who see advertising as something to be sold and information as something
to be controlled, we are determined to construct
on-line public libraries, available free of charge to everyone on this
planet.  We have already begun such a library, and will begin
transmitting its books to anyone with a satellite dish.  We do this
both as a moral duty to provide mankind with this knowledge, and also
as a legal right, because as a sovereign nation the Republic of Mars
can operate these transmitters, much like the United States operates
the Voice of America."

Mercuriou: "We believe that political freedom is meaningless
without economic freedom.  It isn't enough to let the Maldives have an
election.  They need to build their own computers, their own cars,
their own houses.  To do this they need information, information about
how factories work, blueprints, schematics, source code, chip masks, all kinds of
things.  We live in an information society.  We're making
that information free, rather than locking it down to maintain
economic control."

Mercuriou: "Free technology isn't just about free software, it's about
the environment; it's about going green.  What happens when one of
your capitalist gizmos breaks?  You toss it into the nearest landfill.
Now if the design is open, that device can be repaired.  The
capitalists don't want technology that can be
repaired.  They want throw-away technology.  Instead of repairing
these devices, they want you to buy a new one.  Going green isn't
government mandated carbon scrubbers on smoke stacks.  It's building clean, open,
sustainable technology that everyone can build, improve on, and
repair, and the first step is make sure everyone knows how it is
designed and built."

Mercuriou: "We're committed to freedom of travel as a fundamental
human right.  True freedom comes not from an election, but from
variety among nations, coupled with the freedom to travel.  I call on
the United States to open her borders, to become once again the nation
that beckoned 'give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses
yearning to be free'.  Our own borders are completely open; anyone can
come to Mars, and anyone can leave."

Mercuriou: "We will, of course, abolish this outrageous drug war on
Mars.  It is a gauntlet thrown at the foot of liberty, the
government's claim that it can tell the individual what he can put in
his own body.  All of these 'people's governments' are the same.  They
always end up at war with their own people, and most of them call it
war, too.  The Drug War is America's Cultural Revolution, our
Committee of Public Safety.  We've got a problem, The People are going
to fix it, and the government is going to make the people do it."

Mercuriou: "We're going to build a society where people respect each
other, respect each other's talents and well as each other's
differences of opinion.  We're going to preach tolerance, not Zero
Tolerance.  We're going to build a society where people like each
other, and help each other out."

Mercuriou: "Some of you are wondering how we funded our launch.  Well,
how could we have funded it?  Venture capital?  Only if I'd lied
through my teeth about my true intentions, right?  The government?
They only put Air Force colonels into space, don't they?  So we
developed, let's say, an alternative source of financing.  We robbed a
few banks."

Mercuriou: "I feel as bad about ripping off capitalists as I would
about ripping off communists or fascists, because to me they're the
same.  Just another bunch of men with some nightmare system to be
jammed down everyone's throats."

[[
It's a bit over the top, but remember, this is our uber-egotistical
Captain Mercuriou speaking, who hasn't experienced his
coming religious conversion.
]]

Mercuriou: "The only opportunity America offers is the opportunity to
sell your soul to these bastards, I mean you really convince them that
you're one of them, that you believe in their nightmare philosophy of
greed, you bring them on your management team, you sign off on some
'business plan' that tells how you're going to patent and control this
technology once it's developed, because they won't do anything for
anyone unless they're getting money for themselves, and then you fight
like hell just to keep 51 percent.  Or you toil away in your garage
for ten years of nights and weekends while working some stupid job
just to pay for the stupid garage, and I'm not much of a garage
guy."

[[
Hewlett-Packard was founded in a garage in Palo Alto,
during the Great Depression.
]]

Mercuriou: "See, spaceflight _can_ be done, but we live in a society
hell-bent on forcing people to work for a System, and telling them
constantly that they have freedom.  You don't believe me?  Ask
yourself if you'd rather be flying into space right now or doing
whatever mindless job you've got?  Our great capitalist leaders could
be mass producing spacecraft by the thousands.  Ask yourselves, 'if
they needed them for a war...'?"

Mercuriou: "Let's apply their own rationale.  I'm 'helping them
compete'.  If a few banks go out of business, so what?  Throw it into
a chapter!  It's nothing personal; businesses fail every day.  I'm
developing technology to fly to Mars, so the whole society benefits."

"We'll have the company.  We'll throw it in a chapter" is a Donald Trump quote, explaining
how he has used American bankruptcy laws to his benefit.

Mercuriou: "Oh, and one other thing... I'm not part of the
majority... I'm a druggie!  I'm a socialist!  I'm an anarchist!  I'm
farther left than Jane Fonda!  I'm more anti-American than Eagle Six!
I'm against everything 'The People' believe in, and they're against
everything I'm for!  I'm not part of the majority, and I don't like
democracy."

[[
Who is Eagle Six, anyway?

Presumably, in standard military parlance, the commanding officer of a unit code-named "Eagle".

I liked the name and wanted to use it at this point in the novel,
so I decided to adopt it as a pen name, changed the authorship of the novel,
and set out looking
for various ways to assume "Eagle Six" as a moniker.  I created
a new email account eaglesix@freesoft.org and used
that identity to contact a literary agent about publishing
_Icarus_Wing_.  I eventually received a rejection letter
pointed addressed to "Mr. Baccala".  Maybe I took it too far,
but I don't think so.

Is Captain Mercuriou "more anti-American than Eagle Six"?

Well, at this point in the novel, the character is rabidly anti-American,
hates America, really, for how he has been treated when he tried
to make a language learning tool freely available to the world.
The author, on the other hand, is only anti-American in a tongue-and-cheek
manner, with all of his pompous anti-Americanism (the requirements
list at the beginning of the novel) gradually
exposed as nothing more than sly innuendo.

So, yes, Captain Mercuriou _is_ more anti-American than Eagle Six!
]]

Mercuriou: "'The People'.  They make it sound like it's what _all_ the
people want.  Then why do people blow up federal buildings; why do
they bomb our embassies, why do they burn the country's flag?  Why do
we have the largest prison system in the world?  Do the people locked
up in there choose their own leaders?"

[[
Timothy McVeigh blew up the Oklahoma City Federal Building;
American embassies have been bombed in at least three cities
(Beirut, Dar es Salaam, and Nairobi) by Islamic fundamentalists,
and flag burning has been practically become a cliche.
]]

Mercuriou: "Obviously, there's a lot of people who don't agree with
America, and I'm one of them.  The majority makes up these rules, and
then expects everyone else to obey just because they're made 'through
a democratic process'.  People obey the rules because they're afraid
of what will happen to them if they don't.  The only thing that's
different about democracy is that it's a different group of people
making the rules.  In Russia it was the proletariat; in Germany it was
the Aryan race; here it's the majority.  It's always the same.  Some
big bunch of people think that because they're more genetically
advanced, or because they're the workers, or because there's more of
them than anybody else, that they become 'The People' and they have
the right to rule over everybody else."

Mercuriou: "But there are alternatives!  Not many left on Earth, mind
you.  Earth is civilized, which means it's been conquered, colonized,
and commercialized.  No matter where you go, there's some established
government, be it democracy or dictatorship, and you're just a little
cog that better turn when its supposed to and not need too much oil.
Out here, though, an entire solar system is waiting to be tamed!"

Mercuriou: "The first thing we're going to do is land on Mars, and
plant our flag there, because that is where our capital will be!  Then
we'll explore the asteroid belts.  If we find almost anything
valuable, gold or silver, platinum or pure silicon, it'll be 1849 all
over again!  And when you think that there's a whole planet out there,
all broken up into pieces already..."

Mercuriou: "Then we'll have something Earth wants!  Then we'll trade
with them on equal terms!  Then we'll have freedom!"

Mercuriou: "Think about joining us!  Maybe not literally, at least not
yet, but perhaps spiritually?  We have a website, when it is not
blocked.  We have satellite equipment, when it is not jammed.  What
skills can you offer?  Let us know!  Write a biography of yourself!
Upload it to our website!  Join our movement and help build a new
tomorrow!  Onward Martians!  Onward to Mars!"

It's supposed to be a "long political rant".  I don't want it
to be so long as to bore the reader, so I tried to make
it just long enough to qualify as a "long political rant".

T + 3 days    authority must be defied

_Xplorer_One_ began her third full day in orbit amid a jumble of cargo
modules, nearly two dozen of which had now been assembled into a
dense, interlocking tree.  Burns and Alister were planning their next
series of orbital maneuvers, while Vic was organizing the medical
supplies and Mercuriou reviewed video recordings of the major
political talk shows.  Andrea was squirreled away in module C-3 Electronics
Lab, studying the ship's infamous "library".

It was extensive, numbering well over ten thousand books, completely
electronic, and mostly illegal. Every major publisher of technical
books in the English language had been targeted by Burns' super-hack,
and the few books they wanted which Alister couldn't spirit off from
the publishers' computers had been purchased and scanned in by illegal
immigrants. Without launching more than a few pounds of books, most of
those for nostalgic value, the _Xplorer_One_ crew enjoyed easy access
to major reference works on every aspect of technology. There was an
entire book, for example, simply titled _Uranium_, that described
almost everything known about the chemistry of that important element
-- it's dozens of compounds, their properties, the reactions used to
convert between them, and of course its nuclear properties, despite
the fact that the ship carried only a small sample of uranium in its
chemistry lab and Burns had no intention at all of using nuclear
fuel. In fact, all of the major chemical elements were well
represented, with entire books on silicon, iron, and dozens on carbon
and its various compounds. The ship's custom navigation software was
littered with references that hyperlinked directly into a book called
_Celestial_Mechanics_. There were dictionaries, encyclopedias,
handbooks, and entire scientific journals. There were books on antenna
theory, orbital mechanics, geology, hydroponics, plant pathology, and
Mercuriou's hand-picked collection of literature, both in translation
and in the original tongues.

Almost as impressive was the software collection. Every major
technical product was present, many including all of their source code,
stolen from the manufacturer's computers by Burns and Alister. The
scientific software was second to none. In addition to Gaussian and
programs like it, there were sophisticated packages to model and
simulate high-frequency microwave circuitry, the most advanced robotic
control software from Japan, factory blueprints for a complete
semiconductor fabrication plant, and several sophisticated
mathematical packages.  There were even plans for a W-88 thermonuclear warhead!
The three-pound computer tablet in Andrea's
hand offered the same information that would fill an elite university
library, and the same software packages available at the most
prestigious research centers. The legal penalties for acquiring and
possessing all of it added up to more than a hundred and eighty years
of prison time.

[[
Can't be done, you say?

Sounds a bit like what China is stealing from the United
States right now (the "greatest transfer of wealth in history", according
to Keith Alexander, a former NSA director), so I tossed in
the nuclear warhead because, yes, they've stolen that too.

https://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/resources/1999/cox.report/theft/pg1.html

I confess that I assign my characters the capabilities of nation-states,
but isn't the same suspension of disbelief required to swallow something like
_Moonraker_'s secret shuttle launch facility (for six simultaneous launches, no less!)
in the Amazon rainforest?

Both stories ask us to believe, "because he's
filthy rich", and most people buy that!
]]

Alister: "We've got a pressure drop," Alister announced on the flight
deck, as a chime sounded and an amber alert window appeared on the LCD
screen to his right.  Burns stopped programming the flight computer
and Mercuriou floated in from his captain's quarters.

Alister: "We're down to 97.4 kilopascals," Alister informed them,
reading off the atmospheric pressure.

Mercuriou: "That's not much," Mercuriou observed.

Burns_black: "Yeah, but it should be a closed system," Burns answered,
sporting a new T-shirt that asked "Why drink and drive, when you can
fry and fly?"

Alister: "97.3," Alister stated.

Burns: "Let's go to Condition Zed," Burns suggested, and Mercuriou nodded.

Mercuriou: "Captain to crew, set Condition Zed," Mercuriou announced
into the microphone clipped to his shirt, while Alister keyed a
command sequence on his computer.  An audible chime sounded throughout
the ship, and the hydraulic doors separating the different modules
hissed shut.

[[
Condition Zebra or Zed, apparently, is a standard "material condition"
in the U.S. Navy, and indicates a "battle closure condition" of water-tight doors:

]]

Andrea: "What's happening?" Andrea asked as she watched the door close
on C-3.

Mercuriou: "We're closing the airtight doors, Dr. Yeats, we seem to
have a pressure leak.  Vic, where are you?"

Vic: "I'm in sickbay, of course," the doctor answered, stopping his
inventory of the ship's drug supply.

Mercuriou: "He's got a spacesuit in there if he needs it.  What about
Dr. Yeats?"

Burns was shaking his head, no.

Andrea: "I don't think there's a suit in here.  All I see is
oscilloscopes and signal generators."

Alister: "We're down to 90 in C-4.  Looks like the rest are holding."

Mercuriou: "That's right next to where Yeats is."

Burns: "It's probably a micro meteor strike, 'cause we're not fully
assembled yet and the shield isn't in place.  But if we lose 'C' node,
she'll be cut off, so we probably want to get her out of there."

Mercuriou: "OK, Dr. Yeats, why don't you exit the module you're in and
come back here to where we've at least got a spacesuit for you, then
we'll check on the problem, it looks like it's in C-4."

Burns: "I can open the pressure doors from here."

Burns opened the door to C-3, and Andrea pulled herself through it
into a mating node.  Burns next opened the door to C-core, which lead
back towards the 767.

But Andrea didn't go there. Instead, she went to the door leading into
C-4, and was about to ask what its pressure was, when she saw it
displayed on the LCD panel by the door. 87 kilopascals. She knew as a
rough rule of thumb that supplemental oxygen wasn't needed until the
pressure dropped to 70. She keyed the sequence on the panel that
opened the door. Designed to seal its pressurized contents against an
exterior vacuum, it popped open under the force of the higher pressure
outside, accompanied by a whoosh of air flowing into the damaged
node. Andrea's sinuses popped under the pressure change.

Andrea: "I'm going to take a look at the problem in here," Andrea
informed the others as she pushed herself into the node.

On the flight deck, colors changed on the computer animation of the
ship's layout.

Alister: "She just opened the door to C-4!" Alister declared in surprise.

Mercuriou: "That node appears to be damaged, it's loosing pressure, Doctor!"

In C-4, Andrea could hear a quiet whooshing of air.  She removed her
water bottle from her belt and carefully squeezed it to release a
stream of liquid aimed straight down the center of the module, then
watched to see where it went.

Meanwhile, Mercuriou had dove to the rear of the 767 and grabbed a spacesuit.

Mercuriou: "Open the door!"

Burns: "Opening main airlock," Burns stated in a resigned tone of
voice as he keyed a computer panel. Mercuriou dove into A-core with
the suit.

Vic: "What's going on?"

Mercuriou flushed red, clenched his teeth, and smacked his fist into his palm.

Mercuriou: "We've got a pressure leak, Vic, and Dr. Yeats, as usual,
is EXACTLY where we don't want her to be!"

Alister: "Aren't you going to prep?"

Mercuriou: "I don't have time! What if she gets stuck in there?"

Andrea released the harnesses on several large packing crates and
moved them aside to follow the trail of the water droplets. A wave of
fear swept over her. _You_have_no_spacesuit_. Calming herself, she
said a silent prayer, _Father,_watch_out_for_me_in_here._

Andrea: "Alister, keep reading the pressure off to me."

Alister: "It's at 82 now. It came back up for a second when you opened
the door, but now it's dropping again."

Burns: "Opening 'B' node," Burns dryly noted as he continued to open
pressure doors in front of the captain, now moving down the central
chain of cargo modules, bumping against walls as he went, partly
because he hadn't fully learned how to maneuver in zero-gee, but also
because he grew ever more irate the further he went.

Meanwhile, Andrea had found the pinhole leak at the root of the
problem. Unlike the space shuttle, designed for manned spaceflight
operations from the beginning, the cargo modules were large pressure
tanks with cargo containers secured to their side. At times this meant
an inconvenient jumble of conduit that could have been better
designed, but in this case it meant easy access to the punctured wall
of the module. She began looking around for something to plug the hole
with, just as Mercuriou opened the door and propelled himself into the
module.

Mercuriou: "Doctor Yeats, we've got to get a few things clear right now..."

Andrea: "Excuse me... sir," she interrupted as she reached for the
spacesuit and pulled out one of its gloves. Turning back to the
puncture, she slapped the glove against it.

Andrea: "That'll hold until we can patch it permanently," she
announced, then put her left hand on her hip while still holding a
cargo strip with her right.

Andrea: "You wanted to get some things clear? First, no matter how
much reserve oxygen you've got now, it's not enough. Second, it's a
lot easier to find the leak while there's still air in here.  Finally,
bring two suits next time.  It'd really suck if we both got stuck in
here with only one suit between us."

Red-faced, Mercuriou stared at her for several seconds, then turned
and left without without saying another word.

T + 5 days    America must be run by fools

[[
The three fools symbolize, advocate for, and represent three foolish philosophies
that dominate American political life: conservative capitalism, liberalism, and the religious right.

The goal of this chapter is to show up everything wrong with capitalism except the Christian case against it,
because Mercuriou hasn't had his religion conversion yet.

Capitalism discriminates against people who are generous.

Some might argue that this chapter, and the others like it, is too preachy,
but I disagree.  Dialog has been used effectively in books like
_Two_New_Sciences_.  Shakespeare wrote almost nothing but dialog.

Where dialog goes off the rails in _Men_Like_Gods_, for example, it gets preachy,
and that was H. G. Wells, so even the best writers fall victim
to this enticing temptation.

_Men_Like_Gods_ doesn't work because there's only one voice speaking.
There's two characters, but because they agree so much, they sound like
my sterotypical progressives in the next chapter.  All they do
is agree with each other.

Effective dialog has to present believable antagonists.  I try to
make mine a little bit goofy to help undermine their arguments, though.
]]

Perhaps because of his attitude, perhaps because of his altitude,
perhaps because of his impunity, completely beyond the reach of any
terrestrial authority, or perhaps simply because of what he said and
how he said it, _Captain_ Marc Mercuriou seemed to incite the ire of
nearly every American political leader, regardless of party
affiliation or personal background.

Ecks: "Get the hell out of the left lane, fifty-five!"

[[
The most common American speed limit is 55, and the left
lane is customarily reserved for faster traffic.  The
politician is not only breaking the law by speeding,
but is actually angry at someone else for obeying the law,
who he denigrates as a "fifty-five"

He's also in a big rush.

Of course, I'd also be angry at somebody driving 55 in the left lane.

Congressman Richard Ecks yelled out his window, leaned on his horn and zoomed around the
slower car, passing it on the right.  His radio and TV show had been
on the air longer than he had been in Congress, and this harried
commute from his office on Capital Hill to his studio in Fairfax had
become a daily ritual.  He pulled into his reserved parking spot and
hustled inside, skipping the elevator and instead jogging up three
flights of stairs.

[[
A parody of Rush Limbaugh, may he rest in peace.

Ecks symbolizes capitalism.

Certainly by 2005 or so I had conceived of calling these
characters X, Y, and Z, or Ecks, Wye, and Zee.
]]

Ecks: "What did I miss?" he gasped as he reached the top, where his
producer met him with a blank stare.

"Nothing.  We're still on with the space captain at five."

Ecks gulped down one of the steamed broccoli and banana seed
milkshakes that he relied on to keep his 300 pound bulk under control.
He changed, put on his makeup, drank half of another milkshake at his
desk on the set, then set it out of view as the cameras came on.

[[
Rush Limbaugh pushed various weight loss schemes:

How would you extract the banana

to look like a "fool".
]]

Ecks: "Good evening, and welcome to 'Outside the Beltway'."

[[
"His radio and TV show had been on the air longer than he
had been in Congress", and it's always been called
"Outside the Beltway".

The Beltway is the Washington, DC beltway.

He imagines himself a political outsider, pushing
populist views against the capitol's liberal elite.
After he gets elected to Congress, he still fancies
himself a populist outsider, but it becomes harder to
maintain this image, thus his frantic commute.  He
still refuses to admit that so many of those liberal
policies he despises were promoted by elected Congressmen,
just like him, and that he has become a Washington, D.C.
wheeler-and-dealer, just like them.
]]

Ecks: "Capitalism has produced a society with the highest standard of
living that has ever been seen on this planet.  People are well-fed,
well-housed, generally content with their jobs, with a surplus of
leisure time and disposable income.  Yet our opponents slam us at
every turn because they can't stand the idea of people working hard
and getting rewarded for that work.  Now this thief comes along, this
criminal who has taken advantage of our society, stolen from our
businesses and our government, lied, cheated; he comes along with the
nerve to blame capitalism for what?  For letting him take advantage of
our freedom?  For giving him the opportunity to pull of one of the
greatest con jobs in history -- the 'Republic of Mars'?  Let me start
by asking you, _Captain_ -- how do you justify your theft?"

Mercuriou: "Same way they justified Hiroshima -- it had to be done."

Ecks: "Hiroshima?  We were at war, a war Japan started!"

Mercuriou: "_Japan_?!  What _Japan_?  The women and children, the
innocent civilians that died, _they_ started the war?  _They_ attacked
us?  We did what we _had_ to do to win, and there was some 'collateral
damage'.  Same thing here.  Nobody even got killed!"

[[
Various American leaders have justified not only
Hiroshima, but also slavery, the armed conquest of the American native tribes,
the armed conquest of Mexico, and a slew of lesser conquests
designed to contain either Communism or Islamic fundamentalism.

Of course, Japan justified the Rape of Nanjing, the conquest of China,
the torture of American prisoners, and the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor.

Just saying.
]]

Ecks: "And how... what war... again, how do you justify your theft?"

Mercuriou: "It had to be done!  To stop capitalism!  To stop democracy!
It had to be done!"

Ecks: "...and all that justifies theft how?"

Mercuriou: "It has to be stopped!  Just like fascism!  Just like
communism!  Now, I did what I had to do.  I've answered your question,
so move on."

[[
I imagine that he really believe this.  His egomania, to me, is not
demonstrated so much by his theft, but by the fact that he really
thinks that his plan will set in motion the defeat of capitalism!
]]

There was a pause, and then another.

A cocky smirk spread over Marc
Mercuriou's face, and he reached dramatically for a prominently positioned red switch.

[[
The implicit threat is to end the interview, but he's the big star now,
so nobody is inclined to challenge him.
]]

Ecks: "Alright, _Captain_, capitalism may not be perfect, and this
country may not be perfect, but what sets us apart from communism and
fascism is our commitment to freedom."

Mercuriou: "Freedom?  What freedom?  You have the freedom to be a
capitalist, or to work for the capitalists, or to be put homeless on
the streets!"

Ecks: "Well, I guess freedom _is_ limited for people who don't want to
work..."

Mercuriou: "Let's shortcut this debate.  'Work' is a propaganda term
that means 'making money', right?"

[[
"Work" _is_ a propaganda term.  I define a "propaganda term" as a term
with multiple definitions or connotations that is used in a deliberately
vague way in order to obtain victory in an argument or debate.

"Work" can mean "making money", or "taking care of yourself",
or "doing something productive", and they all get mixed up
together to the benefit of the propagandist.

Other important propaganda terms are "freedom" and "democracy".

Freedom - are we talking specifics, or the freedom to do whatever
you want?  Can I commit murder?  Is that freedom?

Democracy - OK if I pile a hundred thousand people into your
state for election day?  Is that still "democracy"?
]]

Ecks: "No, 'work' means 'work'!  Work is what you do to put food on
the table.  We have to work in order to eat, Captain.  We have to work
to have houses, cars, clothes, computers, all of it.  We have to
sustain ourselves!"

Mercuriou: "How do you sustain yourself?  By refusing to do for people
unless they pay you?  How does that sustain anyone?  But you dodged my
question, Congressman.  Are you defining work as making money, or
doing something productive?"

Ecks: "There's no difference!  That's the beauty of capitalism; people
get rewarded for hard work, and have the freedom to invest however
they please!"

Mercuriou: "No difference!  Some kid makes millions throwing a
baseball, and a father of five make pennies pushing a hot dog cart!"

Ecks: "We have _freedom_!  People can choose
what work to do, and what to do with their money.  You can be a
businessman if you choose, you can be a social worker if you choose,
you can be an author, you can be a doctor, you can be a baseball
player; it's nothing imposed by the government; it's your choice!  You
can be Mother Teresa!  And you don't like to hear this, Captain, but
most people want to better themselves through hard work, not
charity handouts!"

Mercuriou: "Capitalism rewards people who _do_for_themselves_!  If you
won't work for them, you're thrown away like a piece of human garbage,
you're talked to like garbage, you're treated like garbage, you're
told to _get_a_job_ and _do_what_you're_told_!  The only way to get
rewarded for hard work is to slap a credit card form on everything!"

Ecks: "Because in the real world, if you just give everything away,
you'll be out of business!"

[[
The American people, with their "freedom", could have
choosen to live lives of sacrifice to help the world; instead most people
seem to want the biggest pile of money they can get.  The United States
could be known as a nation that is gives its technology
away for free, has turned the Library of Congress into
an Internet Library of Alexandria, always welcomes
immigrants, and encourages smaller nations to become
self-sufficient, but instead it's become known as
the land of big business.

To be sure, some Americans have choosen that life of sacrifice,
but the majority have chosen something much different,
and nobody should kid themselves into thinking
that democracy won't be judged by what it
has produced.
]]

Mercuriou: "That's right!  That's the 'freedom' of capitalism -- you
become a capitalist or you'll be put out of business!  We pay pitchers
millions a year, support video game, music and film industries that
rake in billions a year, blow half a trillion a year on the military,
but we can't afford to house people?  Capitalism is
depraved!  Your leaders are trash!  Your entire society is built on
forced labor for these creeps!"

[[
In the first edition, I had "feed people in restaurants" instead
"house people", and I changed it because this country's churches
do a halfway decent job of feeding people.  Housing the poor
they don't, and it's a serious problem because people are
crippled when they lack what architects call "pride of place",
or, in other words, a "home".
]]

Ecks: "Freedom, Captain, Freedom!!  Who the hell are you to tell
someone else what they can and can't do with their property?!!  How
dare you, you socialist crook, you shameless thief, how dare you tell
someone who's sweated tears and blood that they have to give
everything away for free?!  I've let you rant on because I felt like
listening to your bombast! You're like a blind man screaming 'You
Blinked!'  How are you so much better than all these terrible
capitalists?  You're the worst kind of capitalist -- you've stolen
billions of dollars to build your own dream!  You needed
money -- that's why most people go to work in the morning!  That's why
all these evil capitalists don't just publish all their books on the
Internet -- because the authors need money to write them, money to
print them, money to put food on the table in front of their children!
You've got a problem with _authority_, _Captain_!  Let's take a break
now and I'll introduce our next guest when we return."

[[
Congressman Ecks can't just be a straw man or the dialog wouldn't
be very captivating.  Later, I'll try to make sure our
reformed Captain Mercuriou does a better job of answering him.
For now, let me just say that all of his cynical talking points are
absolutely true.  One of the few rational reasons not to
live as he suggests is if you believe in a life after death,
and that life is more important to you than this one.

Senator Patricia Wye had been a fixture on the Washington scene for
decades, first as a dutiful wife and more recently as a power broker
in her own right.  Seated comfortably by the fireplace in the Senate
Reading Room, she looked about her as a pre-recorded Ecks hawked the weight loss benefits
of a banana seed diet,
The chair was positioned precisely; the coffee cup was filled to exactly
the correct level; an edge of the ornate rug could just be seen on the
video monitor.  
She waited until the tally light came on before
smiling, to make this act seem more spontaneous.  As she fell easily
into a familiar patter with Ecks, the cameraman noted that her frosted
blond coiffure hadn't changed in twenty years.

Senators and their staff.

Ecks: "Senator, what do you say to Captain Mercuriou?"

Wye: "Only that this country is run by its people, through their
elected representatives, and the capitalists do not own everything.
If anything, it's the other way around.  Capitalism is chosen by the
people and regulated by the government."

Mercuriou: "Oh, it's regulated, all right.  You've got laws to
regulate factories, you've got laws to regulate fisheries, you've got
laws to regulate farmers.  If you chose decent leaders to begin with,
you wouldn't need all those laws!"

Wye: "Well, we have to have laws, Captain.  Our opponents wants a
society with no rules, but my vision of capitalism is that of a level
playing field where businesses can compete honestly, officiated by the
government, much like a sporting content."

[[
"Our opponents" are the conservatives like Congressman Ecks, who
she jabs at by suggesting that they want "a society with no rules".
She's not debating Ecks directly, but she certainly doesn't agree
with him.
]]

Mercuriou: "Why?  I'll tell you why.  Because otherwise you'll have
two factory owners build on the same river.  One will be clean and
safe; the other one will just dump his waste into the nearest pond.
The first one will go out of business in a year, and the second one
will retire at forty laughing 'Ha ha ha, you can't _com-pe-te_!'"

Wye: "And we don't allow that, captain!  We allow free markets and
free enterprise because they are beneficial to society, but we also
need laws to protect the environment and ensure a level playing field,
so that good corporate citizens are not victimized by abusers.  Would
you have us abandon the Clean Air Act, or the Clear Water Act?  We
have food stamps because we're not willing to let people starve!  We
have social security and Medicare because we're not willing to put the
elderly out on the streets!"

Mercuriou: "And who pays for it all?  More taxes?  Or just run it all
up on the national credit card?  How about a magician pulling a
kerchief out of his fist -- can he do it for the Federal Reserve?"

Wye: "We have to control spending, but we're not doing it by getting
rid of the programs that we have decided are necessary."

Mercuriou: "Bottom line -- if America is so great and so wonderful,
why do we need all these government programs?"

Wye: "Because these government programs help make our society great!
We allow free enterprise, we allow competition, we allow people to
earn a reward from their labor, but we also have programs in place to
achieve a clean environment, a safe food supply, reliable
transportation, a minimal social support system.  Women and minorities
need protection against discriminatory labor practices, and children
deserve a quality education.  These decisions are made through a
cooperative political process."

Mercuriou: "Your decisions are made on a TV game show, vastly
elaborate, with stages all over the country, and oh so expensive!
You've got to be flying everywhere, giving speeches, buses, banners,
balloons, all kinds of buttons and bumper stickers!  It costs huuuuge
amounts of money to play, the judges watch everything on TV, and they
have an average IQ of 100!  This is what your government has been
since the invention of television!  It's got troops all over God's
creation, enough national debt to last a half century, the biggest
prison state in the world, a wall across its southern border, and now
it's out to enslave the planet under globalization!  I call it a Game
Show Government, and it's a disaster of truly Biblical proportions!"

Wye: "We're governed by our Constitution..."

Mercuriou: "You're governed by a TV Game Show!"

Wye firmly grabbed her head, re-adjusted her hair, then laughed.

[[
Foreshadowing her later "wardrobe malfunction".
]]

Wye: "So now you're against democracy..."

Mercuriou: "Greek gods, am I against it!?  It's tyrannical!  It's
premise, that this one group of people, this majority, are somehow
entitled to rule over everyone else just because there's more of
them; it's a tyranny!"

[[
"Greek gods" is, I believe, an original expletive that I invented
for Captain Mercuriou, meant in the sense of "My God", or "Good grief".

Now, people will read this and say that I "hate democracy" or that
I "hate the United States".

I try to recognize that the rest of the world doesn't look
any better than the United States, so whenever I'm tempted
to say that I "hate the way I've been treated in the United
States", or "hate the way the majority of the American people
have treated me", I try to rephrase this and say that
I "hate the way I've been treated in this world",
or I "hate the way the majority of people have treated me".

Furthermore, as a matter of principle, I try not to hate anything or anyone.
So I don't "hate democracy", I just don't believe in it anymore.

It can't deliver on its promises.  It can't give us this "freedom" that it hypes,
because human nature is too wicked.  What democracy has given us is a coercive society
based on forced labor for money, and that's pretty much the best you
can expect from human civilization right now.

We Christians call this "The Gospel", or the "Good News", and it doesn't sound like
good news at first, but it's the truth, and only bad news would start with a lie.
The really Good News is that there's life after death, and from the sounds of it,
it's fair, much to the dismay of people who tell us that "life isn't fair".

So don't believe the majority's hype.  Putting the masses of people in charge
produces a tyranny of people motivated by greed.

...

The only utopian communities that have survived for any
period of the time are the Catholic religious communities -
the Benedictines, the Franciscans, the Cistercians, etc,
all of whom date to medieval times.  The Mormans
are an interesting case, really about the only surviving, purely American
utopian experiment that I'm aware of,
and they've largely abandoned their utopian roots
and settled down as another Christian denomination.

Wye: "We have a participatory government, Captain!  The people can
petition their government to change the laws, and if enough people
want change, the laws _will_ change!"

Mercuriou: "You didn't say the people could _participate_!  You said
the people could _choose_their_own_leaders_, but in fact only the
majority get to _choose_their_own_leaders_; they do it on a TV Game
Show; everyone else participates, and loses!  Hell, I'll take
'participatory government' any day!  You participate, and I'll make
all the decisions!  I'll even have my own TV Game Show!  What do you
say?"

[[
I'd like to have a TV Game Show.

I could even live stream it on my website!
]]

Wye: "What do the people of this country want?"

Mercuriou:  "I don't care what they want, it's not what I want!"

Wye: "What about the _majority_?"

Mercuriou: "All they want to do is to get rich, get tough, and get laid!"

[[
It's supposed to be a clever way of saying
that the majority want to make a lot of money (get rich),
they want a strong police and military (get tough),
and they want to have sex (get laid).
]]

Wye: "What about the people?"

Mercuriou: "Oh, get off your cracked track!  What's so sacrosanct
about that magic 50 percent, that _majority_?"

[[
Phonograph records are organized in tracks, and
a crack in the record will sometimes cause the needle
to skip backwards in the recording, which then repeats in a loop.
]]

Wye: "You'll have a dictatorship, captain, but I suppose that's what
you had in mind all along!"

Mercuriou: "Nobody can just rule over everyone else like that.
Nobody!  Nobody has that right!"

Wye: "I've got a mission update for you, captain!  The people of this
planet have decided on democracy and we're not going back!"

[[
One my favorite original expressions in the novel.  If you don't
agree with someone, tell them you've got a "mission update" for them!
]]

Mercuriou: "I don't care.  I won't accept it.  Nobody should."

Ecks' final guest on the program was the Reverend Caiaphas Zee, a
prominent Southern Baptist minister who had transformed a failed
presidential bid into a mega church empire, and who now seemed content to
advise the politicians he could not supplant.  Standing in his pulpit
on live T.V., clad in a black cassock and a starched white collar, a
simple wooden cross hanging from a cord around his neck, his graying
countenance seemed the very personification of a prophet of God.

[[
He's a mix of Pat Buchanan and Jerry Falwell.  Caiaphas was
the high priest who presided over the trial and execution
of Jesus.  Our Caiaphas has high priest fever - real self-righteous,
thinks he's got the Bible all figured out, always looks
to judge and condemn others.

The simple wooden cross _I_ sometimes wear postdates his considerably.

His was checked into git on June 4, 2011 via commit cffa8a,
when I working on the novel while homeless in Haleiwa, Hawaii.
That was the last date I committed anything until March 12, 2012,
and I have a commit on July 3, 2012 with comment "Bring up to date with published version".
Adding his "simple wooden cross" must have been one of the last
changes I made before ordering 100 copies of the first edition,
though the June 4th date seems strange to me, since I waited for two months
or so for those books to be delivered to Hawaii,
but surely I was in Alaska in the summer of 2011.

My cross came in the spring of 2017;
I was hitchhiking home through western Pennsylvania when
one of my drivers gifted it to me after a short ride.
The rope has broken and been replaced, but it's still
the same cross.
]]

Zee: "Captain, you are a liar and a thief!"

Mercuriou: "I've said everything I intend to say on that issue."

Zee: "Then let me say more!  We have laws not because they are made by
man, but because they are commanded by God!  We are told 'thou shall
not steal'!"

Mercuriou: "If that's all you want to discuss..."

Mercuriou reached again for the switch, but Zee thundered on.

Zee: "Throw the switch, Captain, go ahead!  That's all I want to
discuss!  'Thou Shall Not Steal'!  'Thou Shall Not Steal'!"

Mercuriou paused, then threw the switch.  Nothing happened.  He grinned.

Mercuriou: "OK, Reverend, so maybe I won't switch you off just yet."

Zee: "Thou Shall Not Steal, Captain, _Thou_Shall_Not_Steal_!  God's
laws _command_ capitalism!"

Mercuriou: "God's laws or man's laws?"

Zee: "God's laws, Captain, God's laws!  No sex!  No drugs!
And one more... _Thou_Shall_Not_Steal_!"

Mercuriou: "No sex?"

Zee: "Don't you play word games with me, mister!  You know what I
mean!  Marriage between a man and a woman!"

[[
Zee, of course, opposes adultery, homosexuality, pre-marital sex,
gender changing, polygamy, and group sex.  He himself is happily
married to his lovely wife of yadda-yadda many years.

In short, he has sex mostly the way he wants, and tells
others their sexual activities and even attractions are immoral.

Personally, I think the Gospel teaches celibacy and,
at least for some, castration (Matthew 19:12).
Giving up sex is like giving up meat or giving
up worldly possessions.  It's a sacrifice
whose purpose is to live more holy lives.
]]

Mercuriou: "Yet capitalism is moral... _why_?"

Zee: "Because God does not allow the government to steal!  The
government is responsible for public safety; the church is to handle
charity!"

Mercuriou: "After taking out a nice income for its preachers..."

Zee: "Our ministers deserve every cent of that tithe, mister!
We live that gospel every day!  Our people work to help
the poor, and many of them give quite a bit more than ten percent.  We
have some _very_ generous members in our congregation."

[[
The traditional Jewish tithe was ten percent of income to support the priesthood.
Various Christian denominations have adopted it in one form or another.
]]

Mercuriou: "You've got this nightmare of capitalism that's another
slavery all over again..."

Zee: "It is not!  We don't bind men in chains to force them to work!
You should have been a politician; instead you became a thief!  Now
nobody will listen to you!  Now I'm throwing the switch!"

Ecks interrupted before Mercuriou could fire back.

[[
Zee "throws the switch" by prevented Mercuriou from replying.
]]

Ecks: "Well, our time is growing short, captain, and it looks like our
prison system is going to remain a little short, too.  I don't think
it's worth the trouble and expense to apprehend you right now."

Mercuriou now broke out into a long, almost genuine laugh.  Ecks paused
for a moment, then kept talking without waiting for him to stop.

Ecks: "There's really no harm in leaving you be.  You'll eventually
have to come back down.  In the meantime, when you make it Mars, _if_
you make it to Mars, do us a favor.  Have the dignity to plant an
American flag there.  It's the least you can do for the country that
footed the bill."

[[

T + 7 days    it must be offensive

Mercuriou's next T.V. appearance was on a daily political talk
show, funded by the U.S. federal government, whose host had become a multi-millionaire
from book deals, speaking fees, and shrewd business dealings.

Lucy: "Good evening.  Wecome to _People_Power_, _The_People_Power_Project_,
the _Power_To_The_People_ Report, and _Populism_Now_; I'm Lucy Liberal.
Our next guest is well known to our viewers,
Dr. Alishah Reynolds-Meyers, ARM, welcome."

[[
Basically, it's Amy Goodman and Nikole Hannah-Jones, at least in this chapter.  Of course,
her "acronym" ARM is a slight variant on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, AOC.  Later,
ARM is fashioned more after Richard Dawkins than any American politico.

They're a send up of progressives.
They always agree with each other, and all they talk about is race.

Yes, she is actually called "ARM" conversationally.  Remember, this is satire;
all of these characters are supposed to look a little bit goofy, except
those espousing _my_ viewpoints, who look reasonable, principled, and even heoric.
]]

Dr. Alishah Reynolds-Meyers, more commonly known as ARM,
was a prominent Black activist with a prestigious tenured chair
at an Ivy League university.  Her preferred pronouns were
she/her and she sported an afro
the size of a basketball dyed black on one side
and white on the other.

[[
If you asked her, she'd say that her hair represent the ying and the yang.

Actually, a basketball is about the right size for an afro, I think.
The basketball might even be a bit too small, but it sounds good
in the novel.
]]

Lucy: "Several commentators have noticed the lack of racial diversity in the
makeup of the _Xplorer_One_ crew, ARM, all of these people are whites,
is that correct?"

ARM: "That's right, Lucy, one of them is from South Africa, which gives
this crew a _semblence_ of diversity, but of course,
Alister Compton is a _white_ South African, and we all remember the
history of White South Africa."

[[
Why is Alister from South Africa?

Becuase I knew a kid from South Africa named Alister and I liked him.
]]

Lucy Liberal now made a point of turning some pages in a file folder laid open
upon her anchor desk.  Her viewers imagined that the file folders, a prominent prop on her show, contained
every obscure fact and tantalizing tidbit bit of innuendo that could be thrown at her opponents.

Lucy: "So this crew is not racially diverse, but of course this is not
a typical American corporation or government venture, this is a criminal enterprise, right?"

ARM: "That's right, Lucy.  It just goes to show how pervasively
racist the United States of America is, that even her criminal
enterprises are pervaded by racism..."

Mercuriou: "Now, just a minute here..."

Lucy: "We're also joined by the leader of the _Xplorer_One_ mission,
Captain Marchelius Mercuriou, but I want to circle back to what ARM just said,
even America's _criminals_ are racist?!"

ARM: "Of course America's criminals are racist!  The entire society
was born and bathed in racism!  Every aspect of American culture
is pervaded by racism.  While black criminals are carjacking Jaguars
white criminals are launching private space missions!"

[[
The real Kyle's Jag briefly flashes here again.
]]

Mercuriou: "Now, just a cotton-pickin' minute here!"

Lucy: "Captain Mercuriou, please do not use that kind of racially
insensitive language on this program!"

ARM: "My ancestors were chained to plows to pick that crop you
just named... I won't even speak its name..."

[[
It's all true.  Slavery was America's gulag.

Just to be clear, the targets of the satire are progressives, not Blacks.
]]

Mercuriou: "Look, I'm just trying to say that I didn't hold a hiring fair for this mission!"

ARM: "Yet somehow you have an all white crew!"

Lucy: "Captain, we know you didn't hold a hiring fair, so how exactly was your crew selected?"

Mercuriou was becoming visibly exasperated.  He took a deep breath,
exhaled, and launched into an explaination of how his crew had been selected.

Mercuriou: "I approached two of my best friends, men I've known and trusted for years,
and asked them to embark on a venture where secrecy was paramount and trust was implicit."

ARM: "So, you asked your white crew if they wanted to steal a billion dollars and blast into space with you?"

[[
Yeah, pretty much.

Double entendre on "crew"
]]

"No, one of them is a medical doctor, and the other is a very accomplished engineer.
Along the way we encountered a very promising young chemist and software developer,
a real science and technology expert really, and persuaded him to join us.
Then Dr. Yeats joined us."

Lucy: "...and how exactly did that happen!"

Mercuriou paused again before answering.

"Dr. Yeats is a NASA engineer and astronaut who was asked to investigate
the manufacturing plant we were using as our cover.  When she discovered
the true nature of our operation, I ordered her arrested _for_a_brief_period_ to protect
the operational secrecy of the mission.  After I released her from custody, she
choose _voluntarily_ to join our crew."

[[
This is called "spin".
]]

ARM: "A _white_ astronaut!  Didn't NASA have any colored or Hispanic astronauts available!?"

Lucy Liberal flipped her pages.

Lucy: "73 percent of NASA astronauts are white."

ARM: "It's one of the least diverse populations in our country."

[[

Mercuriou: "What the hell you want me to do, appoint a diversity officer!?"

ARM: "No, captain, I just want you to acknowledge that the first
manned flight to Mars is all crewed by whites!"

After the interview concluded, the Captain emerged from A-1 Captain's Quarters
to face a stony-faced woman.

Andrea: "Don't tell people you released me.  I escaped."


T + 54 days    nobody must work

By now, halfway to Mars, the ship had assumed a stable configuration
as a tree of cargo modules,
each a solid steel cylinder fifty feet long and ten
feet in diameter, equipped with female mating connectors on both ends.
These were interconnected using circular nodes equipped with six male
mating connectors, each with about as much interior space as an automobile.

The 767 was
docked directly to A-core, the ship's bridge, which contained several
large flat-panel LCD screens along its walls, showing the ship's
position in its orbit, its ground track, and a radar composite
extending two hundred kilometers around the ship.
 
The other end of the bridge connected to 'A' node, from which modules
A-1 through A-4 fanned out to its sides.  These were the main crew
quarters; each of the four original astronauts had been assigned one.
Continuing along the main axis was 'AB' core, intended to serve as a
crew lounge.  Its far end was docked to 'B' node, from which the
ship's sickbay, in modules B-1, B-2, B-3, and B-4 fanned out.  The
crew's working modules continued in this manner from A to F.  A
hydroponic garden was planned to start at node G and continue through
to node R.  The dozen modules around S, T, and U were purely for
storage.  After U, the remaining cargo modules stored fuel and water.

[[
How the hell did four people build that in less than two months?

Especially if nobody works!

Some will see it as a metaphor for liberalism/socialism/communism.

Really, it's just part of the sly humor.

I originally included this description of the ship on T + 3 days,
but cut it in commit fa8c92 right before printing the first edition in 2011.
Once I realized that a ludicrous assembly schedule would fit
right in to the chapter subtitled "nobody must work", I dug
it out the git history and restored it here.

Are the sizes realistic?  An Interstate highway lane is
twelve feet wide, and a typical tank trailer
is eight feet wide.  Tractor trailers in North America are up to 57 feet long,
and Skylab was 82 feet long and had a 21 foot diameter.
Leaving aside issues such as radiation shielding, these
cargo modules would each be a good bit smaller than
Skylab, but _Xplorer_One_ has over a hundred of them.

How would things like electrical, air, and water connections
be made between them?
]]

Alister: "Whoo-hoo!"

Alister barreled down the module at the speed of a racehorse, his
arms flailing wildly.  He pulled them in to his sides and made his
body rigid as he sailed through a mating node into the next module.
Now he waved his arms in front of his face.

Alister: "Ahhhhh!"

Again he pulled his arms in to his sides, passed another mating node
and began gyrating wildly.

Alister: "waHHHH!"

[[
Space tourists, do not attempt.  Professional author on an imaginary spacecraft.
]]

He tucked, grabbed a handlebar as he flew into the 767, and spun
around into a pull up that he released with just enough backward
momentum to let him glide into the cabin.  Droplets of sweat from his
forehead kept going, spraying out over where the rest of the crew were
talking.

Andrea: "Look, there are certainly plenty of people who would love to
quit their jobs, throw off their leaders and fly away into space, but
how are they supposed to get up here?  The simple fact is that you had
to steal billions of dollars just to launch five people into orbit, and
that's fairly consistent with NASA's cost budget.  What you're
suggesting is completely impractical."

Mercuriou: "OK, I'll concede that they're not going to make it up here
exactly the way we did, but what's the alternative?  There's nothing
left on Earth.  It's a failed planet turning into one big global
hegemony."

Andrea: "You can't rationalize a decision just by saying that the
alternatives are unacceptable."

Mercuriou: "Why not?"

Andrea: "Because the solution to missing the school bus is not to
invent a time machine!  Sometimes _all_ of your options are
unacceptable.  Then it becomes very easy to pick the most attractive
one and gloss over its manifest defects.  That's why we have planning
meetings and project cost estimates, Gantt charts and Capability
Maturity Models.  If _none_ of your options are capable of hitting
your target, then you need to know that _before_ you push the little
red button in the launch tower!"

Mercuriou paused and studied Dr. Andrea Yeats.

Mercuriou: "Andrea, I have studied these options.  The one I've chosen
certainly has a lot of defects, but I really am convinced that it
might work.  Mars, I admit, is a bit of a publicity stunt, but after
we've landed there we've got to take a close look at the asteroid
belt.  There are probably more minable mineral resources there than on
the entire Earth.  If we can set up a manufacturing plant there, with
the robotic automation technology we've got, then we can build more
ships like this one.  We've already built one, so we know how to do
it.  We can set up hydroponics to grow food, establish a colony there
and send ships back to Earth to bring more people."

Vic: "We're not going to need the hydroponics, Marc."

Mercuriou: "What do you mean?"

Vic: "I'm not sure, Marc.  It's just real clear to me now that you're
not going to need a doctor, and you're not going to need the
hydroponics."

Mercuriou: "So...what?  We're just going to give up after a year and
go home?"

Vic: "Maybe.  I don't know."

Mercuriou: "What then?  You're saying we're going to die up here?"

Vic: "No, I didn't say that, either.  I can't really explain it, Marc,
except to tell you that I wrestled mightily trying to decide whether
to come along on this.  I know now that it was totally worth it; I'm
thrilled to be here; I don't question it now for a minute, but I also
know that... I've gotten _centered_, Marc, I don't know how else to
explain it, I've gotten centered, and I understand now that my
presence here is totally superfluous.  You don't need me... not
really."

[[
Is Vic totally superfluous?  He "represents" the more shamanistic
native religion of tribal America, and that seems pretty
superfluous in modern society.  His restraining force on Mercuriou
helped create Andrea's escape, but I could just rewrite that
scene.  Yet how could I drop the vision quest, or the dinner scene?
We need you, Vic!  Even if for just two scenes in the novel!
]]

Andrea: "We need you, Vic."

Mercuriou: "What happens when our food runs out?  We'll need the hydroponics!"

Vic: "I don't know."

Mercuriou: "You've just got... one of your 'feelings'?"

Vic: "More like a certainty."

There was another long pause.

Andrea: "Look, you've made your point.  Now we should test this
spacecraft in a controlled environment where there are rescue options
both in orbit and on the ground."

Mercuriou: "We're going to Mars, Dr. Yeats, that's not going to
change."

Burns: "She's got a good point, Marc."

Mercuriou guffawed.

Mercuriou: "First Vic, now you going turn traitor on me too, Burns?"

Burns answered with a laugh of his own.

Burns: "Hey, I'm just saying that what she says makes a lot of sense!"

Mercuriou: "Burns, the minute, nay, the second these wheels touch the
ground, we're just five little nobodies at the mercy of those
governments."

Andrea: "We could contact a neutral country...  Switzerland might let
us land."

Mercuriou: "Sorry, Doc, it's not worth the risk."

Meanwhile, almost imperceptibly, their dramatic space
launch changed from Breaking News into Established Fact, and promptly
vanished from the media news coverage.


T + 72 days    nobody must play by the rules

The latest news updates from Earth had brought word of an explosion in
Nigeria that had killed hundreds scavenging gasoline from an illegally
tapped pipeline.

[[
This actually happened on November 30, 2000, but it's too far
back from my timeline of mid-2001.  Can I find a similar
better timed event to trigger the same reaction from Mercuriou?

Maybe Dennis Tito's trip on April 28, 2001?  But I want to
launch around April 2001.

June 1, 2001 - Nepalese royal massacre and Hamas bombs a disco in Tel Aviv, killing 21

July 20-22 - G8 summit in Italy.  Demonstrations; one protestor killed by police

Still, the pipeline scavenging evokes Lycurgus better than any of these events.
]]

Mercuriou was grinning.

Mercuriou: "Lycurgus would have approved."

Andrea: "You can't be serious."

Mercuriou: "Why not?  The African capitalists want to pump oil and ship it to
America while their own people starve.  What's wrong with a little
'competition'?"

Alister: "Who was Lycurgus?" Alister asked as Andrea shook her head in
disgust.

Mercuriou: "He was the founder of Sparta, maybe the greatest socialist
success story ever."

[[
Plutarch, _Lives_of_the_Nobel_Grecians_and_Romans_.
]]

Alister: "Were they Communists?"

Mercuriou: "Not exactly.  Or maybe they were, depending on how you
look at it.  The parents didn't raise their children, for example, the
children were raised by the state.  And their education consisted of
leaving them to starve unless they could steal food to eat."

Alister: "That's insane!" the youth replied.  "Why on Earth wouldn't
they feed their own children?"

Mercuriou: "Lycurgus wanted a nation of warriors... and he got it.
Maybe Nigeria can be the next Sparta!"

Andrea: "Mankind's determination to train children to do evil _is_ amazing."

A taunting grin materialised on Mercuriou's face.

Mercuriou: "Well, maybe you can do Lycurgus one better, Doctor.  Maybe you
can prescribe a set of rules for us to raise our children to be
Christians instead of warriors."

Andrea: "I think Jesus already gave us those rules far better than I
could.  Sell your worldly possessions and give to the poor.  Give
to all those who ask, including thieves; love and pray for everyone,
including your enemies; see people as God sees them; work for God, not
for money."

Vic: "The problem is that people don't play by those rules.  Just
because the teachings are transmitted, doesn't mean they're
understood.  Just because they're understood, doesn't mean they're
practiced.  They're talked about all the time, but mostly it's just
talk."

Mercuriou: "I don't know about that, Vic.  Edward Gibbon thought that
Christianity was a major factor in the downfall of the Roman Empire.
At first the Romans were Pagans, they gloried in the martial arts,
taught their children the virtues of war, worshiped gods like Mars and
Jupiter.  Then came along the Christians, everybody started turning
the other cheek and forgiving their enemies, before long, no more
Roman Empire.  What amazes me about Western civilization is how
pervasive is this notion that the individual somehow owes something to
the state, or at least to the society.  In ancient times it was
obedience to the King, now it's obedience to democracy.  And of course
people are obligated to work, too.  That's all gotten embedded into
the religion.  It's all part of propping up a society."

Alister: "But people have to work to live, right?  I mean, people have
always had to eat!"

Vic: "It's true that people have always had to work to eat, Alister,
but this notion that people have to work _for_the_society_ is what
we're talking about.  Take the Native Americans, for example.  If
anything, they believed that society had a responsibility to the
individual to raise him to be independent.  They taught their kids how
to build fires by rubbing sticks together, not by buying a lighter at
a store.  They were taught to recognize wild plants as edible or
poisonous, to build a shelter or a bow and arrow just from the natural
materials you'd find lying about in a forest.  The net result was that
by the time they were fifteen years old, they could literally walk out
into the woods and take care of themselves.  Their society was more
voluntary.  If anyone didn't want to be there, they could just get up
and leave.  Murders, robberies, the violent crimes that we're so
familiar with, were almost unknown.  I think it was because they
raised their children to be truly independent, while Western society
for generations has raised people to be dependent.  Most people
wouldn't have the slightest idea how to feed themselves if they
couldn't walk into the supermarket with a twenty dollar bill in their
hands."

Alister: "So we should give up our technology and go back to living
like Indians?"

Vic: "It might not be a bad idea.  The human race might be too
primitive for all this technology.  You'd definitely be healthier
living in the woods; maybe happier, too.  What I'm trying to say is
that industrialization had radically transformed human society, and
the shock waves are still being felt.  In the last hundred years,
we've gone from a primarily agrarian society to a primarily industrial
one; we've gone from people living on farms to people living in
cities.  That means people are dependent on each other to an extent
never before seen, not in all of human history, and that exacerbates
the problems.  Most human societies are based on coercion, on greed,
on the domination of man over man, of the strong over the weak.  The
more industrialized society becomes, the more dependent people are on
it and each other, and the more oppressive society can become.
There's just no way around this, unless millions of people are going
to decide to change their human nature, to abandon greed for
generosity, force for persuasion, and rights for responsibilities."

Mercuriou: "So the philosophers have turned to politics to try and
find their freedom there.  Their latest dopey idea is democracy; they
keep trying to convince us that freedom is to be found in that dumb
vote, and don't you dare try to tell these people otherwise.  They'll
scream you down as a Communist until the work bell rings.  Go to
church on Sunday to hear how you need to work, work, work so you can
give, give, give when they pass around the collection plate."

Andrea: "Marc, do you still need me to distinguish true Christianity
from bastardized Christianity?  Jesus didn't teach us to work to eat,
in fact, just the opposite.  He taught us not to worry about food, or
clothing, or housing.  He said to put your faith in God for those
things.  He pointed out that the birds in the air don't sow the field,
or reap the harvest, yet God provides them with all the seed they need
to survive.  Jesus taught us to put God first, put your fellow man
second, and let God take care of the rest."

Mercuriou: "That sounds good, Andrea, but faith in God didn't get any
of us here.  None of the companies that sold us this equipment did it
for God or for love.  They did it because they thought they would get
something out of it for themselves.  We got here because we were
willing to take it."

Andrea: "That's funny, Marc, because I don't remember taking anything
from anyone.  Faith in God got _me_ here."


T + 107 days    there must be a sex scene

The club was packed, and the music was pounding.  Colored beams of
light flirted with the twenty-something revelers on the dance floor as
strobes pumped with the beat and lasers scanned above the fog that
poured down from the rafters.  Along one wall, a half dozen bartenders
scurried behind a mahogany counter, pushing out beer and liquor as
fast as they shove hundred dollar bills into their cash registers.  By
the bar and in the alcoves, older men flirted with the youth, or just
rested for a moment with their backs against the wall.  The crowd,
high on liquor and pot, sweat and sex, moved and vibed with the latest
hip hop hit.

{{	games are addictive }}
{{	games are insane }}

Alister weaved and bobbed with a twenty-year-old brunette wearing a
tight white top and blue slacks.  She brushed against him as they
twirled and then pressed her head against his chest.  Breathing deep,
he inhaled her fragrance and squeezed her tight.

{{	games waste your time }}
{{	games waste your brain }}

"You know what?" she whispered in his ear, "I want to see you in your
underwear!"  They kissed, hard, lost in the crowd, the beat pounding.

{{	books are the ticket }}
{{	books are the tool }}

Alister: "Let's take a shower!" he yelled over the music.  She shot
him a coy look.

"You want to have sex?" she asked.

Alister: "No, no, I mean, maybe, I don't know, I just mean, probably,
but I just want to take a shower with you, I think it'd just be fun!"

{{	books ain't for nerds }}
{{	books ain't for fools }}

Suddenly Mercuriou was there!

Mercuriou: "What the hell are you doing!?" he shouted, "You're
supposed to be looking for Andrea Yeats!"

Yeats!  Where was she!?  He was surrounded by a mob of people.
Where was Andrea Yeats!?

Alister: "Wha... what?" Alister blubbered as he jolted awake.

He was alone in his darkened compartment, wearing a pair of headphones
connected to the laptop floating nearby.  Yanking them off, his heart
pounding, he listened intently for the captain's voice, but heard
nothing other than the constant hum of the air conditioner and the
tinny noise squeaking out from the headphones.  He yanked the cord
from the laptop.  Silence.

Calming, he stretched and exhaled.  Grabbing hold of a pillow floating
nearby and squeezing it in a tight embrace, he dozed back to sleep.
_Man,_she_was_HOT._

[[
The point is that Alister wants to go home.

Maybe we should move this later in the novel, during their long return.

T + 124 days    madness must prevail

[[
How long does it take to get to Mars?  Mariner 7 did it in just
over four months (128 days), but executed a flyby and never entered Martian
orbit.  Our heroes have infinite fuel, so I gave them 124 days
to get there.
]]

Mercuriou: "We _have_ to land."

Andrea: "Why?  Why do you have to land?  You've already accomplished
more than any other space mission to date.  _Xplorer_One_ will go down
along with with Vostok 1 and Apollo 7.  So what that we didn't
land..."

Mercuriou: "We have to land!  People don't
remember Apollo 7; they remember Apollo 11!  If we don't land, they'll
say we failed.  Then they'll come back a few years from now and make
the first landing on Mars; hell, they'll use our technology to do it,
and everyone will remember Captain so-and-so or Major such-and-such
saluting the first American flag on Mars!"

He now swung his face close to Andrea's and lowered his voice.

Mercuriou: "But they'll be too late!  _I_'m planting the first
American flag on Mars -- face-down in the Martian dirt!"

More than ten million people were watching the crew conference live on
television.  Now settled into Mars orbit, and with a landing attempt
only days away, most terrestrial cable TV systems devoted a channel
full-time to the _Xplorer_One_ video feed.  During the crew's sleep
cycle, a scrolling orbital panorama of the red planet's surface had
become a standard fixture on many a TV screen, highlighted by a small
colored box labeled "LIVE -- Mars Orbit".

Andrea: "So let them!  Why do you have to risk everything just to win
your private little war?  Or do you seriously think that you can
survive down there?"

Mercuriou: "Well, maybe you find this hard to understand from your
cushy NASA perch, but there's a lot of people back home rooting for us
to show the world that you don't have to become one of these ruthless
bums to get something done in life."

Andrea: "Oh, please!  Don't you?  Haven't you?  How many billions did
_you_ steal, Marc?  How many toes did you step on?  Don't tell me you
haven't become ruthless!"

They locked eyes.  Mercuriou fell into his slow-and-firm,
no-nonsense tone of "command".

Mercuriou: "We are landing on Mars.  That has been a
primary mission objective since day one.  We take the risks as they
come.  If you learn to live with disappointment, she'll never leave
you for someone else."

[[
"Disappointment" is personified as a lover who never leaves you.
]]


T + 140 days    it must be garrulous

[[
garrulous - excessively talkative, especially on trivial matters (Oxford Languages via Google)

If the reader even knows what garrulous means (I had to look it up via an synonym search
for "long speech"), they might expect Mercuriou's speech to be garrulous, but it is in fact
Vic's dinner, thus the double entendre.
]]

Vic: "Marc, we want to talk to you."

Vic and Andrea floated in unison before the hatchway to A-1 Captain's Quarters.

Mercuriou: "All right."

Vic: "Let's go inside, please."

Once the three of them were in his quarters, he turned on them.

Mercuriou: "You two are ganging up on me!"

Andrea_Vic: "That's right" "You're damned right we are!"

Vic: "Marc, you can't do this thing with the American flag!
It's just too offensive!"

Mercuriou: "It'll send a message!"

Vic: "What message?"

Mercuriou: "That we mean business!  The People will support us!"

Andrea: "If you say so."

Mercuriou looked back and forth between the two.

Vic: "Marc, if you insist on doing this, I'm staying behind in orbit."

Andrea: "Don't you have your own flags?  Republic of Mars flags?"

Mercuriou: "This is mutiny!"

Vic: "Marc, it's the first manned landing on Mars.  You'll get plenty of attention.
Try to send a message of unity and not division."

Three hours later, the ship retro-fired out of Martian orbit, and Burns backed _Xplorer_One_
slowly into the Martian atmosphere.  The 767's wings, designed for Earth's denser atmosphere,
were nearly useless, but Burns had thought of that, too, and the engines were gimbaled
to allow their force to be directed downward.

[[
Can you really turn a 767 into a VTOL aircraft by putting its engines on gimbals?
I doubt it.  How would you balance its center of gravity?
]]

After cruising in the Martian sky for almost an hour, the Captain selected
a landing spot at the base of a cliff.  A broad plain stretched away
to the west, and a nearby canyon cut back into the cliff face provided access
to the rim above.  The ship touched down without trouble.

After doning their spacesuits, the crew decompressed the cabin
and opened the left front door.  Twelve feet below them lay
the Martian red regolith.

Burns moved an elevator lift into position outside the door,
then the five astronauts pushed some equipment onto the platform, followed
by the five astronauts.  A motorized winch lowered them to the ground,
and, in unison, they all stepped together onto the Martian soil.

[[
A platform that slides out from the cabin door of a 767 and holds
five people, plus equipment.  Hmmm... let's just try to imagine
that for a minute.
]]

After spending a few minutes walking around, Mercuriou asked Alister
to set up his props a short distance in front of the TV camera.
Then, a man wearing a spacesuit, standing behind a podium on
a red plain backed by distant red mountains and flanked
by the twin flags of the Republic of Mars,
delivered a speech heard live by over three billion people on Earth.

"My fellow Martians!  I stand before you on a momentous day!
Landing Day!
On this red soil, we will build the capitol of our republic,
the first human settlement on Mars."

"To whom, might you ask, am I talking?  Who are my fellow Martians?"

"Dare I suggest that you might be one of them!"

"If we come back next orbit with ten ships, that's enough to hold two hundred people!"

"The real question you need to ask is this: Are you willing to move to Mars?"

[[
That is the real question of the politcal agenda that I'm proposing here,
are you willing to move to Hawaii?  To Alaska?  To Kathmandu?

Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal.  The term is used figuratively
to refer to a far distant place.
]]

After a dramatic pause, accidently highlighted by a dust cloud shifting in the background, the Captain concluded.

[[
Foreshadowing, and not of the accidental kind.

I mean, why not?  I've got the novel 99.9% done, I'm doing a little editing
and I come across "After a dramatic pause, the Captain concluded".

Surely we can do better than that!  Some little iconic Martian image,
something red, a mountain, a boulder - why not a dust cloud?
Why not spice up the description with a little foreshadowing?
]]

"I'm not speaking for long today.  In closing, just consider this: Might you be one of us?"

"It is a truly momentous day!  It is Landing Day!  The first human Martians have set foot on Mars!"

[[
OK, that's the closest I can get to "one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind".

In true Captain Mercuriou style, it comes not as the first words he uttered,
but at the end of a speech.
]]

"Here is my plan!  Having demonstrated the viability of this technology, we will leave a cache
of supplies here, and return to Earth in a few months.  Then we will
confer with our allies on Earth and begin plans for a return expedition
with more ships."

"Who are these allies?  Again, you may be one of them!"

After a few hours on the ground, they returned to the cabin,
pressurized it, and took off their spacesuits.

[[
I just had a Dr. Seuss / Theatre of the Absurd moment and
started giggling all over myself, thinking how funny it would
be to list out this enormous feast consisting of every
favorite meal I can think of.

I actually took it from a list called "Things of Men" that
I wrote during a long fast in the Chugach Mountains.

Think this better be in iambic pentameter, or people will hate
to read it because it won't scan.  Well, it better be some
kind of unrhymed verse.  Iambic pentameter is the easiest.

I used to have a computer program that looked words up
in a dictionary and marked their accents automatically,
but I marked this text by hand rather than fool around
with finding the program and getting it running.  Slashes and dashes are accented
and unaccented syllables within a word; backtick
are secondary accents; dots are
single syllable words that can't be categorized
as either accented or unaccented except by actually
scanning the line of text.  I like to read it
a little more heavily accented on the iambic pattern
just to make sure it scans well; like a spellcheck.
It's meant to be read normally, though, as prose,
so I don't use any special line formatting
to cue to reader to its regular metric.

I've got to do something special for Landing Day!

So we get "Brent Baccala's favorite foods in iambic pentameter",
which I think is the single silliest thing in this book!
]]

Finally, they finished eating.

Mercuriou: "Vic, that was amazing!"

Burns: "Vic, that was imcredible!"

Andrea: "Vic, how did you do that?!"

Alister: "Vic, that was, like, the third-best meal I ever had in my life!"

[[
What were the other two?!

Two friends of mine were helping a third friend of mine; true story.
When they showed up at his house, he asked them if they were hungry,
they said yes,
and he slapped some food together in about five or ten minutes.
They often claim that this was "one of the top three meals" they ever
ate in their lives.

Of course, in the story, Alister is young and naive and just
blurts out whatever he's thinking.

Vic: "Well, while Burns had been building the spaceship, I've been making dinner!"

But I decided to cut this line and let Alister's outburst end this scene.

There used to be a scene at the beginning of the novel where he brought them lasagna, but I deleted it
because I thought it was superfluous.  I'll check the word count when
I'm done and maybe bring it back.  Even if I don't, it's in the git history.
]]

Something they hadn't anticipated was the falling temperature.

Burns: "The aircraft fuselage really isn't insulated that much.  It relies
on air conditioning while the engines are running to maintain
cabin temperature.  In space it wasn't a problem, because vacuum is a great insulator, but there's
enough of an atmosphere on Mars to draw off heat and cool the
cabin."

Vic: "And it will get colder after the sun goes down?"

Burns: "Yes."

Andrea: "It's already pretty chilly in here," Andrea opined as she doned a sweater.

Alister: "It's cold as hell!" Alister blurted out.

[[
Elton John, _Rocket_Man_
]]

Mercuriou: "OK, let's prep for launch and get back to orbit.
For now on, day trips only!"


T + 150 days    somebody must die

[[
In the first edition, they crashed on their first landing attempt and thus never
landed on Mars.  This was unsatisfactory from a plot standpoint because
there was no good way to explain why some of the crew remained in orbit.
Also, I came to believe that the novel was about 10,000 words too short,
which caused it to read more like a novella at times, like the scene at Andrea's family farm.
Also, Mercuriou's overall motivation was confusing with so little back story.
I had deliberately
kept it short so that people would read it, but now it was too short.

None of these problems seemed fatal; adding a second opening scene
(it used to start with the super-hack) and a landing scene were
straightforward solutions.

So the disaster scene (this chapter) has now become a later landing,
and that makes the plot more believable, that some of them
remain in orbit.
]]

Four landings later, Burns and Vic were on the ground unloading supplies
from the 767 as the remaining crew worked in orbit to stage additional cargo
for the next landing.

Burns: "I think we've got a storm coming in," Burns remarked
as he gazed toward the horizon from the top of the cliff.
A dust cloud obscured any view of the mountains that loomed
to the east.

Vic: "Is that a problem?" Vic asked over the radio, as he moved some
of the smaller items into the sealed bins intended to protect the cargo from
just such a Martian dust storm.

Burns: "It could be.  We don't know that much about Martian weather."

Vic: "It'll take us another hour to get everything unloaded."

Burns: "Let's get it done.  We don't want to take cargo back to orbit.
And we don't want to be here overnight."

By the time they had finished unloading, the wind and dust were swirling around
them as they closed the door.  Burns took off his spacesuit and grabbed
a drink from the galley, then fired up the engines and took off.
His T-shirt today read:

EASY AS PI

[[
That's what he's thinking now: this is easy.  All he had to do
was get back to the ship and get the doors closed before
the storm really picked up, and he's done that.
]]

Burns: "We're getting a lot of vibration," Burns reported from the
left hand seat at he launched the 767 skyward into
Martian atmosphere.

Vic: "Is that unexpected?" Vic asked.

Burns: "It didn't happen before; I'm going to climb to get away from this storm."

Burns pushed the throttles forward.  They were now ten
kilometers high, and he was clearly expecting the vibration to ease.

Mercuriou: "Burns, you, uh, you've got a lot of atmospheric turbulence
developing around you," Mercuriou reported from orbit, crammed into
A-1 Captain's Quarters along with Andrea and Alister.  Their telescopic
view showed that the dust storm had suddenly transformed into a
raging hurricane, with the tiny rocket plane struggling to
climb away from it.

Burns: "What's going on here?" Burns wondered aloud.  "This should be
dampening!"

Indeed, it was getting worse.  The ship was definitely beginning to
vibrate.  The vibration somehow spread outward from the ship and
coupled into the atmosphere, which responded by swirling around and
buffeting the ship with wind.  Next the ship began to shake like a washing machine.

The 767 was now in the center of a full-fledged Martian cyclone.  As the
engines strained at full throttle, the ship slowed, stopped, and then
began to fall backwards.  In the cockpit, the two men heard a terrible ripping
sound as the rudder tore away from the fuselage and went careening
away towards the red planet below.

Vic: "What was that?"

A wailing alarm, first three red lights and then dozens of red and
amber lights on the instrument panel answered Vic's question.  The
space plane lost its equilibrium, pitched back and began to yaw,
overwhelmed by the aerodynamic forces of the maelstrom, a raging
hurricane with no eye.  The left wing snapped off the fuselage, and
slammed into the battered tail.

In the cockpit, Vic watched the mad swirl of the artificial horizon
like a exposed tank commander staring at an armor piercing round
headed straight for his turret.  He glanced over at Burns, fighting
futilely against the controls, and a calm peace enveloped his soul.

Vic: _Now_I_get_the_answer_key._

Vic: "Is that a clich\'e?"

Vic: "What?"

Vic: "nevermind"

Vic: "I saw an angel, mommy!"

Mercuriou: "Burns?  Burns?"

[[
Oh, now you want to know what this all means!

OK, Vic's last cognizant thought is "Now I get the answer key".

Mercuriou at the end is calling into the comm link, "Burns? Burns?"

The stuff in between are Vic's dying thoughts.  Not really sure myself
what any of it means, but "I saw an angel, mommy," is probably
inspired by a friend of mine whose mother claims she saw him lowered
gently to the ground after a dangerous fall when he was very young.
]]


T + 156 days    suicide must be contemplated

The Captain stopped working.  He moved into A-1-1 Captain's Storage
and let Alister and Andrea do all of the work, or more precisely all
of the work in A-1 Captain's Quarters, because Kyle's Mission Control
facility in Houston was now constantly on one of the monitors.
Sometimes Andrea would just stop and watch it for several minutes,
unable to directly participate because of the ten minute
round-trip radio time lag.

"Oh, and thought you might want to see this," Kyle announced towards
the end of his 0800 transmission, the first of the morning.

He held a popular American newsstand tabloid to the camera.  A
photograph of their spaceship was overlaid with a drawing of a
wild-eyed seer with deep, penetrating eyes staring directly out at the
reader.

"Apparently some of Nostradamus's quatrains referred to the _Xplorer_One_
-- something about 'the great bird crippled in the night' -- looks
like the death of your chief engineer is only the first of many woes
to befall you guys, let's see, the first death was by dust, the last
death will be by ice, and, oh yeah -- none of you will ever make it back to
Earth alive!  Houston out!"

[[
Nostradamus was a famous French mystic who wrote strange
"quatrains" that many interpret as images of the future.

There's no such "great bird" quatrain; it's used here as foreshadowing.

The first death, Burns and Vic, was by dust, a Martian dust storm.

The last death, everyone else, will be by ice since it was frozen
foam insulation that caused the shuttle disaster.
]]

Andrea: "Thanks a lot, Kyle," Andrea told the video screen as the
transmission ended and was replaced by the usual screen cluster on the
projector.  "When I get home, remind me to read you _your_ obituary
over coffee in the morning!"

[[
The real Kyle can be very insensitive too, Andrea.

Especially when he's drunk.

Maybe this mini-scene should be later in the novel, rather
than right after the disaster.
]]

After finishing her coffee, she knocked on Mercuriou's hatch, entered
without waiting, and closed it behind her.  He turned around,
surrounded in a haze of marijuana smoke, and faced his first officer
as she cued a video on his tablet computer's monitor.

Andrea: "This is what Alister recorded on the high-speed film."

The video showed the doomed 767 in high definition, seen from almost
directly above, buffeted in slow motion by hurricane force winds.

Andrea: "NASA's been able to enhance it to show the eddies."

The video now showed strong vortices coming off of the running
engines, enlarging and growing, twisting and coalescing into a single
massive storm.  Andrea let it play through the breakup sequence.

Andrea: "We've estimated the decent path of the cockpit, but there's
no reason to think that anybody's still alive or that we
have any kind of viable ground rescue option."

The video played on, now showing only the storm slowly dissipating and
disappearing like a voodoo phantom conjured by a pagan priestess.

Andrea: "We just don't know what happened.  The engines obviously
interacted somehow with the storm, but nothing in any of our Martian
atmospheric models predicts anything like it."

Mercuriou said nothing.

Andrea: "Here's our flight plan."

Mercuriou took the tablet she offered him and looked at it briefly.

Mercuriou: "What the hell is this?"

Andrea: "It's our way home."

Andrea: "We can barely move right now.  We've got spare engines in storage.  We can move an engine to the
tail, but it'll take us a month to move it and another month to hook it up,
and that's if we work like crazy.  We can't do it in time.
We'll have to go around a full synodic orbit."

[[
In my imagination, they've somehow got fuel, oxygen, water, electricity fed throughout
the ship.  I guess a spacewalk (or five) is required, but I'm trying to keep this
novel rather short, and describing a spacewalk in detail has already been done
in the first chapter.
]]

Mercuriou met her with a blank stare.

Mercuriou: "That'll take two years."

Andrea: "More like a year and a half."

[[
Mars' synodic period is actually just over two years, but I need this return voyage to take
a year and a half to fit 9/11 and the _Columbia_ disaster into the timeline where I want them.
]]


This time, Mercuriou broke the ensuing silence.

Mercuriou:  "I'm going to sickbay.  I've got a headache."

No one had been in sickbay since Vic's death nearly a week earlier.
The captain keyed the lock, found that it didn't work until Andrea
keyed it, then opened the hatch and pulled himself through.  Andrea
followed, then they stopped and looked around.

The room was immaculate.  Everything had been cleanly stowed,
including Vic's laptop, which was normally floating free at the end of
its tether.

Mercuriou: "Why can't I open the door?"

Andrea: "You're on suicide watch."

Mercuriou: "That's what you think I'm thinking?"

Andrea: "I don't know, what are you thinking?"

Mercuriou: "You don't want to know what I'm thinking."

Andrea: "Yes, I do.  I really want to know what you're thinking."

Mercuriou retrieved some pills, Andrea checked them and nodded her
ascent, then he dry swallowed two of the capsules and shoved a third
back into the container before stowing it.

Andrea: "So what are you thinking?"

He floated still and was silent for a while.  Encompassing the entire
ship with a wave of his arm, he answered.

Mercuriou: "I knew that this thing was dangerous.  I guess I always
figured if somebody was going to die, it was going to be me, so..."

He wagged his finger at her.

Mercuriou: "Just like the day we launched!  I made sure if someone died,
it was going to be me!"

Andrea: "We all knew it was dangerous."

Mercuriou: "Oh no, you're right!  We all knew it was dangerous!  It's
just... I... I never thought I'd survive!  If we died, we died!  We
all agreed on it!  We made a pact!  I never thought that they'd die,
and I'd survive!  Oh my God, this is horrible!  I don't know what to
do!  I don't... Oh my God!"

...and he broke down crying like a baby.


T + 199 days    communism must be preached

Andrea had by now received a special dispensation to celebrate Mass
without a priest, and her televised Sunday services, often highlighted
by direct dialog with her congregation of two, had earned her an
unlikely reputation as a space-bourne televangelist.  Today's Gospel
lesson featured Matthew 7:21:

Bible: "Not every one that said to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into
the kingdom of heaven; but he that does the will of my Father which is
in heaven."

[[
Why is this communism?  Because
people who want to
believe that they don't have to do anything to be Christians
accuse other Christians as being communists because they
say we should live according to the Gospel.
]]

Andrea: "This is one of my favorite parts of the Gospel,
because it speaks to one of the deepest rifts in Christianity -
the split between Catholics and Protestants.  Five hundred years ago,
the Catholic church had gotten into the practice of selling
indulgences; essentially telling people that through charitable
donations to the church they could buy their way into heaven.  We have
since repudiated that practice.  Before that occurred, however, Martin
Luther spoke out decisively against indulgences, among other things,
and when he would not retract his statements was excommunicated from the
Catholic church.  He initiated the Protestant Reformation, founded the
Lutheran Church, and adopted the doctrine of Justification by Faith,
which teaches that salvation is achieved solely through accepting
Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior.  In one form or
another, this doctrine is accepted by most Protestant churches."

Andrea: "Matthew 7:21, however, shows that Justification by Faith, at least in
its most extreme form, is itself seriously flawed.  Merely mouthing
the name 'Jesus', no matter how piously done, is not a substitute for
actually doing what God wants.  Christ told us the same thing, a
little bit differently, in a parable.  Let's look at Matthew 21:28:"

Bible: "What do you think? A man had two sons; and he went to the first and
said, 'Son, go and work in the vineyard today.'  And he answered, 'I
will not'; but afterward he repented and went.  And he went to the
second and said the same; and he answered, 'I go, sir,' but did not
go.  Which of the two did the will of his father?"

Alister: "Actions speak louder than words."

Andrea: "Precisely.  So when Christ says that not all who call him
'Lord, Lord' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do
the will of his Father in heaven, not only is it an amazing
suggestion, that God actually has a will for each and every one of us,
all six billion of us, but it provides a simple statement of what our
goal should be in life -- to do the will of God."

Andrea: "This, of course, is much easier said than done, to the point
where _discernment_ has become a buzzword in religious communities.
Some advocate meditation; St. Ignatius developed a lesson plan; Vic's
technique was the vision quest.  Rick Warren developed a more
autonomous approach.  He encourages his readers to look at their own
skills, their own interests, their own limitations -- in short, their
own gifts, and achieve discernment by asking how best to invest them,
as in the parable of the talents.  Whatever the method, the attitude
is that of a servant, and the goal remains the same -- to do the will
of God."

Mercuriou: "I haven't done the will of God."

Andrea paused.

Andrea: "None of us have.  You've
built a platform from which you are heard.  Now, did
you need to steal a billion dollars to do that?  Did anybody have to
die?  I doubt it.  I think you could have found another way.  This is
why I don't buy the Christians who say you have to fight violently
against evil.  First off, it's un-Biblical --
_resist_not_he_who_is_evil_.  Second, if there was ever a time when
you could have justified a revolution, it was two thousand years ago
when slavery was as commonplace as money, paganism was the religion of
the masses, and Rome was the terror of the Mediterranean.  Yet Christ
didn't condone any revolution; didn't lead a protest march on the
governor's residence; didn't stage a sit-in at the slave auction.
Didn't do a thing to oppose his own murderers, and didn't let his
disciples oppose them either.  What he _did_ do was teach; and in the
beginning of John is this beautiful passage about the Word.  'In the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
God.'  Why the Word?  Because the Word is the weapon of the Christian,
and the fire of God erupts from the mouth."

[[
In an earlier version I had "the pen is mightier than the sword",
but that's such a tired cliche.  I switched to the fire of God
erupts from the mouth; the allusion is to the two prophets
in Revelation 11.
]]

Alister: "But if you don't believe in Jesus?  Who's going to listen
then?"

Andrea: "Well, people used to believe the Earth is flat.  You can
believe whatever you want; the fact is that the Earth is round.  Now I
believe that Jesus returned to life after three days in the grave.
It's like the Earth being flat or round.  People can debate it one way
or another, but it's a question of fact, not preference, and
ultimately either true or false.  I think it's true.  The resurrection
was God's ultimate stamp of approval; it was his way of telling us
that we need to take Jesus seriously.  That's why his words are
printed in red; they are the most important part of the Bible. The
basic rules are pretty simple. Love God - unconditionally, and love
your fellow man - unconditionally.  And maybe everyone says something
different because even though that sounds easy, it can be really tough
to figure it out in practice.  Just like our Gospel reading today -
easier said than done."


T + 210 days    some system must run all our lives

The weeks dragged on into months. Nothing happened. The ship kept on its slow
coast back to Earth. Mission Control kept on purring. Andrea kept on preaching.

Andrea: "They're historical documents, Marc. Just because we believe
in Julius Caesar doesn't necessarily mean he said 'Now the die is
cast' as he crossed the Rubicon."

Mercuriou: "So how can you say all this stuff with such certainty?"

Andrea: "I hardly say anything with certainty. A lot of churches say
all kind of things with certainty.  All I'm sure of is that I've
decided to follow Jesus."

Mercuriou: "Why?"

Andrea: "Well, I could point to all those first century source texts
you've got there that claim it. I could site plausible physical
evidence like the Shroud of Turin, or inexplicable miracles like
Fatima.  I could give you my own testimony.  Yet the bottom line is
I've decided to bet my life on Jesus.
It's like asking why some people
believe in science. They've got all kinds of reasons, but ultimately
it's just how they've chosen to live."

Mercuriou: "Do you believe in science?"

Andrea: "Sure, I'm an astronaut! I just don't believe in it as a
religion, that's all! It's very useful, but it's got limits! We can
look at those stars through telescopes, but we'll probably never know
about life out there unless we invent a warp drive.  We can dig
through fossils for centuries; we'll never know how life was formed
until we invent a time machine."

Mercuriou: "I always thought religion was a sham to keep rich people
in power and tell everybody else to be peaceful and non-violent."

Andrea: "Jesus does what he says; it's an integrated whole. He doesn't
just tell people 'give to all those who beg of you'; there are these
miraculous scenes like where he tells Peter to take a coin from a
fish's mouth to pay a temple tax. Why would he have done that if he
had any money himself? The man must have been penniless."

Mercuriou thought for a moment, then began sobbing.

Mercuriou: "I just can't do it, Andrea!  I can't go on!  I just can't live
with this!  I've blown the biggest thing in my life!"

Tears sprayed off Mercuriou's eyes; in zero-gee they couldn't roll down his face.

Mercuriou: "I'll live in prison... I won't do it!  I can't go on!  I'd
rather be dead!  Oh God, just let me die!"

Andrea: "What does God want you to do?"

Mercuriou: "He didn't want this!  He didn't want me to do this!"

Andrea: "What does he want you to do _now_?"

Mercuriou stopped crying.  He shook his head, then paused and thought for a while.

Mercuriou: "I can't do it.  I can't deal with this, Andrea.  I just can't."

Andrea shrugged.

Andrea: "...then ask him to let you die."

Mercuriou stared at her.

Andrea: "Ask him!"

Mercuriou: "He'll tell me no, right?"

Andrea: "I don't know!  Maybe he'll tell you yes!  You can ask him for
whatever you want.  If you're a disciple, you'll get a lot more of
those prayers answered."

Mercuriou: "How can _I_ be a disciple?"

Andrea: "You become a disciple when you start doing things his way."


T + 233 days    someone must commit suicide

With cork puller still attached, the cork went flying unheeded across
the cabin as the Captain grabbed for the plastic cover and slapped it
over the top of the wine bottle.  Even so, several gobs of the red
alcohol went floating into the air, the liquid's surface tension
forming them into perfectly round spheres.  Andrea laughed, but
Mercuriou remained morose and somber.  The picnic had not been his
idea.

Andrea: "You'd think that after half a year in space, you'd have
learned how to open a wine bottle without spilling it everywhere!"

Mercuriou: "What I've learned," Mercuriou answered, as he spun across
the compartment and swallowed one of the larger floating drops, "is
that air's a lot easier to clean than carpet!"

Andrea: "Alister, the picnic's starting!"

Alister: "I'll be there in a minute," came the reply from the next module.

Mercuriou spilt only a few more drops as he 'poured' the wine into two
wine glasses, each one quickly covered with a flat plastic square.
Drinking from straws was much easier, but an hour earlier, after
Andrea suggested a picnic lunch, Marc had dug into the ship's stores
and produced the glasses alongside the bottle, and they had stood on
tradition, at least for the moment.

Mercuriou: "Cheers!"

They clinked glasses and both laughed as Mercuriou spilled wine all
over his face trying to drink it.  Andrea grabbed a towel.

Alister: "You guys should come in here!" Alister yelled before
propelling himself through the hatchway.

Alister: "Well, m-maybe you want to come in here," he stammered as he
watched Andrea trying to clean Mercuriou's face.

Mercuriou: "What's up?" the grinning Captain asked.

Alister: "An airplane just crashed into the World Trade Center!"

Andrea: "Well, hopefully, nobody was hurt."

Mercuriou:  "I'm sure the pilot didn't make it!"

They gathered around the picnic basket to pray.  Andrea was about to
bless the pilot, but at the last minute reconsidered and blessed the
_people_ in the plane.  Soon Alister was back at the console.

Alister:  "Another one!  Another one!"

Mercuriou once told Burns that there are no great men, only great
ideas, and that genius is the ability to retrieve those rare gems,
that energy and mass are the same thing, related by the square of the
speed of light.  Why the speed of light?  Why it's _square_?  That was
the fine-cut diamond Albert Einstein pulled from the rough.  Tom
Clancy was such a genius.  Khalid Shaikh Mohammad was another.  Both
men had discovered the same fiery sapphire, that unbenonst to the
masses of mortal men, a passenger jet can be used as a
_guided_missile_.  One genius buried his discovery in the pages of a
novel.  The other held its blazing red light up for the world to see
one terrible September morning.

Mercuriou: "Another Timothy McVeigh or something...  The country is so
hated... Hell, you can say a lot about me, Andrea, but I never did
anything like this."

The picnic was forgotten.  At 1431 GMT, September 11, 2001, after
first the event on Earth and then a radio lag of 3 minutes 17 seconds,
the silent _Xplorer_One_ crew watched the second tower collapse.  In the
days ahead, it would be revealed that Islamic terrorists had hijacked
four American airlines.  Two had slammed, full throttle, into the twin
towers of World Trade Center, at one time the tallest buildings in the
world, and headquarters to dozens of major companies; a third hit the
Pentagon; the fourth crashed in Pennsylvania.  Burns would have
suggested imagining the pictures you've seen of jet crash scenes, then
trying to project it 100 stories above you onto a skyscraper in lower
Manhattan.  Later, Burns would have made a quick calculation based on
the published mass and height of the skyscrapers to estimate the
energy released by their collapse -- ten kilotons of TNT -- the size of
a small atomic bomb.  Bankers, mail men, fire fighters, brokers, CEOs,
bus boys -- all lost their lives on 9/11.  A pair of glasses, a morning
cold, an early meeting -- these became the difference between stumbling
away covered in a white dust of pulverized concrete or having your
picture appear on a wall of sorrows over the caption -- "97th floor,
One World Trade, any information please call..."

Within hours, the nation mobilized.  Medical teams sprung into action,
fire fighters dove into the wreckage alongside men who walked up on
the street and volunteered, desperate to find anything or anyone still
alive in the tons of rubble.  Yet the medics remained largely idle,
and the anticipated stream of causalities into trauma wards only
materialized near the Pentagon.

Within days, the world reacted.  NATO invoked its mutual-defense
clause for the first time in its history; a French newspaper declared
"Today, we are all Americans"; the British prime minister flew to
America and quoted Thorton Wilder.

Within weeks, the President fingered Al-Qaeda as the culprit,
declared "either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists",
then bombed and soon invaded Afghanistan.

Andrea: "Maybe you shouldn't go on TV right now."

Mercuriou: "Why?  Because the country's been hurt too bad to hear the
truth?"

Andrea: "What truth?  That the jihadists took advantage of our
freedom..."

Mercuriou: "Took advantage of freedom!?  You make it sound like
anybody can just walk up to one of these training companies, 'hey, I'd
like to fly a 767'... 'sure, no problem'.  You've got to have
_money_ to fly!  How many people would love to fly but it's too
_expensive_?... They took advantage of _capitalism_!  They had the one
thing that will make people say 'yes' in a society that says 'no',
'No', 'NO'!  They took advantage of the fact that Osama bin Laden is a
_multimillionaire_!"

Andrea: "...and attacked a civilian target!"

Mercuriou: "Well, who you gonna attack?  The political leaders, the
President?  They'll just elect a new one and keep going, all hot to
avenge him!  Who really is responsible?  Isn't it The People,
themselves?  Isn't that what they keep screaming, that it's The People
that run the government?  The majority that elects these guys?  Since
it's _The_People_ who run democracy, shouldn't we hold _The_People_
responsible?  And who was in the World Trade Center?  Those
people were the true believers!  They were the _capitalists_!
The jihadists attacked the World Trade Center because it was a _symbol_ of
capitalism, just like the Pentagon is a symbol of _militarism_!"

Andrea: "It doesn't matter."

Mercuriou: "And on God's earth, why, woman, why?"

Andrea: "Because you _forgive_your_enemies_, as we're told in about a
hundred parables!  You don't steal `more money than Bernie Madolf ever
saw' because they won't let you fly to Mars, you don't smash airplanes
into their skyscrapers because they imposed some global capitalist
system on you and you don't invade foreign countries because they
won't obey your dictats!"

Mercuriou: "Andrea, it's like klaxons going off in a cockpit!
Brrrmpf!  Brrrmpf!  Brrrmpf! Whoop, whoop, pull up!  And if the
co-pilot just stays meek and silent, then the plane's going to crash!
You said it yourself, Andrea.  The Word!  The Word!  It has to be
heard!"

Andrea: "You act like people have never heard this criticism.  Don't
you think it's been heard over and over, and rejected, time and again?
They're all off on the warpath now; they're not going to listen to
anything you have to say; you may as well just save it until we get
home."

In America, a dissident's dream had prophesied disaster for the United
States and war in the Middle East.  In Afghanistan, an Islamic
militant dreamed that his nation defeated the United States in a
soccer match and that all of their players were dressed as pilots.  In
Afghanistan, in Pakistan, or perhaps in Khartoum, Osama bin Laden was
smiling.


T + 276 days    some anti-government plot must be hatched


Andrea: "Two thousand years ago we were told
_Give_to_all_those_who_beg_of_you_, but half of us still don't believe
that it was God speaking and the other half still don't believe that
he meant it.  Amen."

By the end of the sermon, Alister had concluded that humanity was too
primitive to be flying to Mars, too primitive to have nuclear power,
too primitive to have global data networks, too primitive to have
hypodermic needles, or air travel, or oil wells or cars, and was
genuinely wondering about the printing press.  Mercuriou's thoughts
went in a more predictable direction, which he shared with Andrea in
private.

Mercuriou: "I cooked up some delusional scheme to achieve an
impossible goal.  I ruthlessly stole billions from strangers, got my
two best friends killed, and am going to be sitting in a jail
cell for the rest of my life. I'm a total failure."

Andrea: "Worry about your relationship with God; get that straight
first, and the rest will follow."

Mercuriou: "Relationship with God?  Did you hear what I just said?
You're still taking about my relationship with God?  I don't think
there's much hope left in this life for Marc Mercuriou."

Andrea: "You're regretting the past and worrying about the future, and
you're doing it all from a mortal perspective.  Start with the
present."

Mercuriou waved his hands, gesturing around him.

Mercuriou: "We're floating in an air-conditioned tube with nothing to
do and no way out.  That's my _present_."

Andrea: "An excellent opportunity for prayer and meditation."

Mercuriou: "I don't know what to pray about."

Andrea: "You just gave me a nice little list!  Forgiveness for the
past; guidance for the future -- two of the most important things for
anybody to pray for."

Mercuriou: "Forgiveness?"

Andrea: "Marc, one of the central tenets of my religion is the
_total_forgiveness_of_all_your_sins_."

For a moment, Mercuriou stared at her silently.

Andrea: "To obtain that forgiveness, we are to commit our lives to God."

Mercuriou: "So a murderer, a rapist..."

Andrea: "If the commitment to God is sincere and persistent, yes, but
we're stubborn and opinionated.  You need to set aside your own goals
and put God first in your life.  You'll still be stubborn and
opinionated, but we can work on that.  First get your course set
straight, then we can trim the sails."

Mercuriou: The two astronauts floated in silence for several minutes.
Finally, slowly, Mercuriou nodded his head in assent.  "What have I
got to lose, right?"  Awkwardly, he clasped his arms around a hand
strap, kneeled against the bulkhead, and was silent.

Andrea: "Do you want me to leave?" Andrea whispered.

Mercuriou: "No."

He sighed, bowed his head, paused again.  Finally, in
a low voice, he spoke.

Mercuriou: "Dear Lord, please forgive me for what I've done..."

...and he started crying again.
Then, for the first time in his life, Marc
Mercuriou relied on God.


T + 383 days    the media must expose themselves

Alister: "Five."

Alister: "Four."

Alister: "Three."

Alister: "Two."

Alister: "One."

Alister's voice clipped off the final seconds before the computer
began the insertion burn.  The slight force from the engine pushed the
crew gently backwards into their seats.  The computer screens showed
their current trajectory, in blue, an open hyperbola that skittered
out off the screen, and their target trajectory, a neat red circle
centered on a green Earth.  As the engine fired, the blue line began
curving more strongly back towards the direction they were coming
from, as another clock ticked down more seconds.

Alister: "Orbital interface in five, four, three, two, one, Earth orbit."

The blue line flicked neatly into a broad ellipse, as Alister breathed a
sigh of relief.  Almost nothing, short of something absurdly
catastrophic, like crashing into the atmosphere, could stop them from
getting back to Earth now.  Even if the engine failed now, they would
be in some crazy orbit that they could get them down from almost
no matter what.  Now he just relaxed and watched the rest of the
countdown.

Alister: "ECO in five; four; three; two; one; Engine Cutoff."

The engine kept running.  The crew furled their brows and starting
clattering on their computer keyboards.  After typing a manual shutoff
command that did nothing, Andrea keyed her microphone.

Andrea: "Kyle, we've got a problem.  Our engine won't cut off."

On Earth, media outlets had carried the spaceship's return as a minor
story.  A few were even carrying the _Xplorer_One_ video feed live.
Now they began cutting to "Breaking News".

"We have Breaking News.  The _Xplorer_One_ spacecraft is experiencing an
engine malfunction..."

One enterprising journalist had enlarged a video frame from the crew
camera and extracted an image from the computer screen to Alister's
left.  It seemed to show a black line intersecting Earth, but this was
in reality only a shadow cast by Alister's tablet computer.

"_Xplorer_One_ is now on a collision course with Earth!" one anchor
exclaimed.  "Experts believe that Europe and Africa may be affected."

The 'experts' in this case were three more journalists, all of whom
agreed that there was definitely a blank line across Earth on the
video frame, and who could make out the continents as well.
Soon TV screens were full of realistic graphic images of the planet with
a black line starting in Keyna, crossing the Mediterranean
between Libya and France, and passing directly over Marseilles
before ending in the Atlantic Ocean.

"This is the trajectory shown on the _Xplorer_One_ computer screen..."

"Residents along the affected path are being warned of the possibility..."

"If you can get to a bomb shelter..."

Meanwhile, _Xplorer_One_ had lost Earth orbit.  The blue line on
Alister's screen had changed to a nearly straight path off of the
screen, and continued to move further off the screen as the engine
continued to burn.  The crew had by now eliminated any obvious
computer malfunction, and had concluded that the values must have
become stuck open during the prolonged burn.

Andrea: "Did you conduct any cryogenic tests with the
values?  Can they freeze open?"

Alister: "I don't think so... I don't know!"

On Earth, Kyle Lankier held a press conference, during which he was questioned
repeated about the collision course with Earth.

"At no time was the spacecraft on a collision course with Earth."

"I don't know what colored lines appear on their displays."

"There was never any danger to anybody on the ground."

"Right now, the spacecraft is no longer in Earth orbit.  It's in a
solar orbit that is slowly decaying towards Venus..."

_Xplorer_One_ was falling towards the Sun!  Media pundits estimated
that while life support would surely fail first, roasting the crew in
a sauna-like environment, the spaceship itself could survive at least
until within 10 million miles of the Sun, where that fiery orb would
loom ten times larger in the sky and deliver a staggering 13 kilowatts
of energy to every square meter of exposed surface area.

Meanwhile, Mission Control had suggested using cutoff values to
isolate the affected fuel tank, and in this manner stopped the engine
after again repositioning _Xplorer_One_ into Earth orbit.

As the thrust stopped, the blue and red lines merged into a
single yellow circle.  They were siting in a circular, six-hour
parking orbit above the heart of the African continent, clearly
visible through the portholes.

Andrea: "Sometimes you make it back alive, Alister!  I've done it
twice already!"

Alister: "There's South Africa!  There's South Africa!"


T + 388 days    treachery must strike

Mercuriou: "My fellow Americans, good evening.  Most of you first met
me floating in orbit two years ago, and have never known me in any
other way.  Since I shall soon disappear into prison, it seems apropos
that I bid you farewell in this manner."

Mercuriou: "An age has passed and other has come in the brief hours
that we have been apart.  I left a nation confident and at peace and
have returned to one scarred and at war.  Half of my own companions
have perished and it seems a miracle that the survivors can only limp
on back home.  Yet here, in the fleet-footed orbital day, I find
myself looking more to the sunrise than the sunset, and feel myself
thrilled again with the joy of youth!"

Mercuriou: "For I see a new nation, rising up out of the ocean as if
in answer to a prayer, a nation conceived in peace and dedicated to
God.  I see a young nation, hewn from the sea by fire and storm,
settled by outcasts from remote lands who sought its yet farther
shores.  I see a nation determined to lead mankind away from its
pitiful servitude to Mammon and into the broad light of freedom."

Mercuriou: "Alas, that nation is not America.  She is committed to the
chain, and only a revolution can break it.  Yet how can we overthrow
the American government?  It possesses the most powerful military in
the world, an able police force, and, most importantly, a majority of
100 million people committed to working for money and choosing their
leaders on a TV game show."

Mercuriou: "We will overthrow their government with democracy."

Mercuriou: "Impossible, you say?  Let's do the math.  In the last
election, Neil Abercrombie was elected governor of Hawaii with 222
thousand votes; James Aiona lost with 157 thousand.  If all of them
voted together, they'd have had 379 thousand.  If the whole majority
came streaming out to the polls for the election, maybe they could
barely muster 500 thousand."

Mercuriou: "How much is 500 thousand?  Well, in a nation of 300
million, it's one sixth of one percent!  Furthermore, under our laws,
American citizens are free to travel anywhere in the United States and
establish residency there for one month only before they are allowed
to vote."

Mercuriou: "So, are one-sixth of one percent of us so fed with up our
leadership, so sick of our own lives, so disgruntled with America,
that are willing to set sail for a foreign land and claim it for our
own?"

Mercuriou: "If so, then take Hawaii and get the hell out of this
country!"

Mercuriou: "This will not be an easy path, and many will oppose you.
I will only be able to encourage you from prison.  It will take years
of toil and struggle, and the first years, especially, will be fraught
with hardships."

Mercuriou: "My great mistake was to reject capitalism without knowing
what to replace it with.  Some look to communism; some look to Islam;
I looked to freedom.  Now that I've met Andrea Yeats, I've learned to
look to _her_ religion, and it is Christianity."

Mercuriou: "My first officer embodies everything that I am not.  When
I took the easy way out and stole billions, she stood cold and lonely
by a highway on-ramp with her thumb out.  When I set out recklessly
for Mars, she told me that our problems were here on Earth.  And when
I was ready to end my life, she taught me to live for Christ."

Mercuriou: "Maybe people claim to be Christians, and even genuine
Christians are also fallible humans who stumble and fall.  Yet true
religion is not found in mouthing words, but in living lives.
Fanaticism in the single-minded pursuit of righteousness is the
greatest virtue.  Don't worry about what you'll wear, or how you'll
eat.  Genuine faith empowers us through God, whose resources are
unlimited."

Mercuriou: "Remember that government is a coercive institution; you
can't force people to love each other.  Yet words are more
powerful than laws.  Seek through _leadership_ to achieve Christian
ideals.  Remind the waiters and cooks to feed the hungry.  Ask the
carpenters to build them homes, and ask the farmers to supply them
produce.  Ask God for these things first, remembering that he works
miracles for those who worship and obey him."

Mercuriou: "Do not work for capitalists!  Insist on Christianity.
Support leaders who base their lives on Christ, instead of supporting
those who pursue money.  Tell your boss that you'll give the customers
any product or service for free.  Does he still want you for an
employee?  Then work for the man!  If not, then part with him and his
wicked lifestyle!"

Mercuriou: "Value freedom not for its own sake, but rather because it
empowers us to live peaceable and holy lives.  Freedom in the absence
of morality is the most destructive force known to man."

Mercuriou: "The majority of the American people are dumbfounded at
what they hear.  That the police are not their pet tool of social
control; that goods and services should be free; that books should be
on-line; that capitalists must be driven out from every post of
leadership; and that they, they, the majority of the American People,
are not entitled to rule over everyone else just because there's more
of them!"

Mercuriou: "Those of us who reject America face stark choices.  We can
continue to live in a society where we have no voice, no opportunity,
and no future.  We can trickle out in twos and threes, trying to find
someplace in this world that doesn't exist.  Or, we can unite, we can
suffer, and we can overcome.  We can find our place in this world by
creating it anew.  We can win an election in one state, make that
state a nation, make that nation a legend, and be known forever as
Hawaiians!"

dominating the TV screen in four boxes, Mercuriou on the upper left,
and each opposing corner more determined than the other two to

"unclear to decide" - she's deliberately written as being all confused
]]

Ecks: "A Christian!  So the thief has converted to God!"

Mercuriou: "Look, what I did was wrong, but there's nothing to do now
but move on.  If you don't have any questions about my speech, I'll
just save some radio power and be quiet now."

This time, he really was reaching for the switch, and there was a
pause longer than the satellite delay.

Ecks: "You seem to have quite an electronic library built up, Captain.
I'd like to suggest a book called _The_Wealth_of_Nations_.  It lays
out our basic philosophy; that a free market economy is the best
method to regulate production in a free society."

Mercuriou: "There's a copy on Gutenberg."

He produced a tablet computer and began reading from Chapter 2.

   In almost every other race of animals, each individual, when it is
   grown up to maturity, is entirely independent, and in its natural
   state has occasion for the assistance of no other living creature. But
   man has almost constant occasion for the help of his brethren, and it
   is in vain for him to expect it from their benevolence only. He will
   be more likely to prevail if he can interest their self-love in his
   favour, and shew them that it is for their own advantage to do for him
   what he requires of them. Whoever offers to another a bargain of any
   kind, proposes to do this. Give me that which I want, and you shall
   have this which you want, is the meaning of every such offer; and it
   is in this manner that we obtain from one another the far greater part
   of those good offices which we stand in need of. It is not from the
   benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our
   dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address
   ourselves, not to their humanity, but to their self-love, and never
   talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages. Nobody
   but a beggar chooses to depend chiefly upon the benevolence of his
   fellow-citizens.

Mercuriou: "Now, is this what we're taught by Christ?  Is this moral?"

Ecks: "What's wrong with asking people to pay what something cost to
produce?"

Mercuriou: "Because you're supposed to 'give to everyone who asks',
even a thief, not turn them away.

[[
Luke 6:30
]]

Ecks: "I'm no theologian; you can direct your religious questions to
the Reverend!  I want to know what's wrong with asking people to pay
what something costs!"

Mercuriou: "Well you can't get away from the religious questions!
That's the whole point!  It's a _moral_ issue!  We are taught by
Christ to make generosity a lifestyle, not an option!"

Ecks: Ecks shuffled some papers.  "So we're supposed to just give away
everything we've got, eh?"

Mercuriou: "Yes, actually!  That's the point of Matthew 19, Mark 10,
Luke 12, Luke 18, and especially Luke 14:33, which tells us that
the cost of discipleship is everything we have!"

Ecks: "Most people have different ideas, Captain.  Most people think
that they can be good, generous hard-working citizens and allocate
their own finances without giving everything away and becoming
homeless beggars."

Mercuriou: "...and they of course expect that everyone else lives that
way, too!  What if someone actually does what Luke 12:33 says and
gives away all of their worldly possessions?  How are they treated
them?  If someone really does what Christ said, she is clearly at a
'competitive disadvantage', so your whole theory of Adam Smith goes
out of wack!"

Ecks: "Well, if they don't want money, if they don't want the
advantages of capitalism..."

Mercuriou: "Capitalism is _unfair_!  It discriminates against
Christians!  You've built a society that rejects Christian principles,
discriminates against Christians, and then claims to offer religious
freedom!"

% MERCURIOU DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THEFT; ECKS DOESN'T WANT TO TALK
% ABOUT CHRISTIANITY

Ecks: "We don't discriminate against Christians!  We don't arrest or
execute them, either; some countries do!  If some deluded 'Christian'
wants to sleep under a bridge, let him!  I wonder if that's true
Christianity, though.  I don't know.  I want to talk about your
screwball secession plan!  First came your idiotic Martian Republic,
and now this!  How will Hawaii survive without the mainland?  Where
will your computers come from, or is everyone going back to eating
poi?"

[[
Poi is a Hawaiian dish made from fermented taro root.
I ate the supermarket version once; I'm not a fan.
]]

Mercuriou: "Hawaii will struggle, but she needs to be independent.
Not just politically, but economically, too.  What she really needs,
what we all need, is to turn to God!  Hawaii needs to do that first
herself, and then lead the rest of world!"

Ecks: "Sounds to me like you want to steal Hawaii and turn it into an
offshore piracy haven, where criminals can steal our technology with
impunity!  How can we compete with a bunch of thieves?!?"

Mercuriou: "You won't be able to compete because your product is
inferior.  What 'globalization' offers the world is a simple deal --
find something to sell, and in exchange you'll get our closed, secret,
proprietary technology that we control.  I'll offer them something
better -- all the software, the chip masks, the factory blueprints --
everything they need to build their own computers, their own cell
phones, their own data networks.  Now, which of these two 'products'
do you think our 'customers' will prefer?"

Ecks: "You do that with your technology, not ours!  We'll stop you!
We'll stop you!"

Mercuriou: "Go ahead!  Stop us!  Get tough!  Go to war!"

Ecks: "I just can't... I can't believe that an American citizen would
push his own country to the brink of civil war.  I can't believe that
any _patriotic_ American would do that.  Why someplace nice like
Hawaii?  Why not Alaska?"

Mercuriou: "Alaska can secede, too!"

Ecks started screaming.

Ecks: "Get out!  Don't go to Hawaii!  Get out!!  Just get the hell
out!!  Get out!  Get out!  Get the hell out!"

[[
RIGHT TO SECESSION.  CHRISTIANITY TRUMPS DEMOCRACY.

It took a hundred pages and at least 20,000 words, but yes,
somebody just had to tell Captain Mercuriou to "get the hell out".

You don't hear it so much anymore,
but in my youth, this was a common cliched response to any
criticism directed at the United States.
]]

Ecks raged on while his producer signaled furiously from the booth.
Finally, he waved his assent, sank back into his chair and let the
camera switch to Wye without bothering to introduce her.

Wye: "We have a long-standing principle, Captain, that states are not
allowed to secede from the Union!"

Mercuriou: "Oh, that won't be a problem!  We'll just wave a bunch
of orange flags around in the air!  You'll let us go!"

[[
The allusion here is to the Orange Revolution in the Ukraine,
though that happened in 2004-2005, a few years after the novel's
time frame.
]]

Wye: "This isn't a communist dictatorship, Captain.  The people will
see through any gang of criminals, no matter what color flags they
wave!"

Mercuriou: "What if every pothead in this country packs up and
moves to Hawaii?  And then voted in the next election?  What would you
do then?"

Wye: "We live in a nation of laws!  You are not going to just
make up rules to interpret the election results however you see fit!"

Mercuriou: "But these are the laws!  We have free movement between
states, and only one month residency before the election!"

Wye: "Our laws were created to implement democracy, and if there are
loopholes, they will be fixed!"

Mercuriou: "In other words, you'll change the law to make sure you
get the election results that you want!"

Wye: "We will enforce our laws, Captain, we will enforce our laws!
You're not the only criminal in this country that can hack some
computer program and find some legal loophole.  Also, I'd like to know
what's going to happen once you overthrow our hated government?"

Mercuriou: "We'll show that minorities can choose their own leaders and
live under a government of their own choice."

Wye: "Minorities do have freedom... we have freedoms... minorities
don't need to secede because they have freedom already!"

Mercuriou: "I don't!  I don't want capitalist rule!"

Wye: "Because you don't believe in democracy!  We have many laws to
ensure freedom, but not for criminals who don't respect them!  You
don't believe in democracy!  You don't respect the will of the
people!"

Mercuriou: "It's freedom for the _majority_!  Nobody else should even
_aspire_ to freedom!"

Wye: "You reject the most fundamental human right, that people can
_choose_their_own_leaders_!  Now, Captain, let me state this
clearly.  The majority rules.  That's it.  You are not going to twist
our laws around to make them mean anything different."

Mercuriou: "I won't accept it!  I'll decide for myself what government
I live under!"

Wye: "I don't... you don't!... You don't believe in democracy!..."

Mercuriou: "Senator, I think your hair is falling off!"

Wye: "What are you trying to imply?!..."

Ecks:  "Actually, Patricia, your hair _is_ falling off..."

[[
By this point Wye has dropped the facade and is really answering
questions, at least at first.  Her hair falling off is emblematic
of her entire scripted image collapsing.
]]

Wye: "Wh-What!!"

In fact, a large section of her hair had apparently detached from the
top of her head and slid approximately to her left ear!  As she turned
her head confusedly and started to grab at what was apparently a wig,
it detached completely and came off in her hands.

Wye: "I can't... I can't believe..."

The camera switched off, leaving only Ecks and Mercuriou flabbergasted
on the screen.  Ecks recovered first and smoothly segued into a
prepared segment profiling the Space Shuttle _Columbus_'s fairly
typical astronaut crew, seven spectacular overachievers remarkable
only for including the first Palestinian astronaut, on whom half of
the piece focused.  _Columbus_'s final mission objective would be to
rendezvous with _Xplorer_One_, retrieve her crew, and return them to
Earth.  Another weight loss commercial followed, and then the Reverend
Caiaphas Zee strode confidently into the video Colosseum.

[[
ANSWERS THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT WHY CAPITALISM IS IMMORAL AND ROMANS 13
DOESN'T REQUIRE OBEDIENCE TO THE GOVERNMENT.  CAPITALISM COMMANDED (OR
NOT) BY GOD.
]]

Ecks: "Reverend Zee, do you take Captain Mercuriou's 'conversion'
seriously?"

Zee: "No, I do not.  He has switched from theft to insurrection, not
from Satan to Christ.  We are taught that government authority is
constituted by God, and Christians are to be obedient to that
authority."

Mercuriou: "Where is that taught by Christ?"

Zee: "Romans 13, it's taught in Romans 13, Captain: 'there is no
authority except that which God has established'."

Mercuriou: "That's a letter of Paul.  I asked for Christ."

Zee practically lept from his pulpit.

Zee: "It's in the Bible!  If you don't believe in the Bible, you're
no Christian!"

Mercuriou: "I'm a Christian, not a Biblian."

Zee: "The Bible is the inspired word of God.  You're no Christian!"

Mercuriou: "I take the Bible seriously, not literally.  Paul was not
Christ.  He knew God, but he didn't come back from the dead.  His
teachings don't have the same weight, that's why we don't print them
in red.  I don't buy Romans 13, especially because the man who
wrote it was ultimately executed by his government!"

Mercuriou: "Paul didn't distinguish between governments, he said they
were all established by God.  Jews in Nazi Germany had a moral
obligation to wear yellow stars?  Because it was the law?  Because
their leaders were established by God?  Do Cubans have a moral
obligation not to meet and criticize their government?"

Zee: "So, government is evil, people do whatever they please..."

Mercuriou: "No, but our _moral_ obligation is not to obey the laws of
government, but to obey the laws of God!"

Zee: "Our laws _are_ moral!  You're just twisting the Bible
around to rationalize your own rebellion!  Part of the law of God is
obedience to legitimate, constituted authority!"

Mercuriou: "So now we're going to 'interpret' Romans 13, to mean
'legitimate, constituted authority'?  I prefer 1 Samuel 12, where the
prophet says 'If you will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his
voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall
both you and also the king that reigns over you continue following the
LORD your God... But if you shall still do wickedly, you shall be
consumed, both you and your king.'"

Mercuriou: "I say you shall be consumed, both you and your democracy!
This country is wicked, wicked, wicked I say!  It's defiant of God!
You stand behind a counter and refuse to feed people when they come to
you hungry!"

Zee: "Capitalism is _commanded_ by God!  We're not socialists!  You
have no right to tell that man who he has to serve food to!  We've
seen what you want in Russia!"

Mercuriou: "The Bolsheviks were atheists, and I'm not talking about
the government!  The government does not have the right to tell a man
who he must serve.  But Christ did!  He was the Son of God!"

Zee: "Christ didn't tell me to hand a crackhead $20 to blow on drugs!"

Mercuriou: "Yes, he did!  That's what happened to Andrew van der Bijl in 1954:"

   The last round in the game was the most subtle of all. It was December
   30. I had to have my application in the mail that day if it was to get
   to London on the thirty-first.

   At ten o'clock in the morning, one of the students shouted up the
   stairwell that I had a visitor. I ran down the stairs thinking that
   this must be my delivering angel. But when I saw who it was, my
   heart dropped. This visitor wasn't coming to bring me money, he
   was coming to ask for it. For it was Richard, a friend I had made
   months ago in the Patrick slums, a young man who came to the
   school occasionally when he just had to have cash.

   With dragging feet I went outside. Richard stood on the white-pebble
   walkway, hands in pocket, eyes lowered. "Andrew," he said, "would you
   be having a little extra cash? I'm hungry."

   I laughed and told him why. I told him about the soap and the razor
   blades, and as I spoke I saw the coin.

   It lay among the pebbles, the sun glinting off it in just such a way
   that I could see it but not Richard. I could tell from its color that
   it was a shilling. Instinctively I stuck out my foot and covered the
   coin with my toe. Then as Richard and I talked, I reached down
   and picked up the coin along with a handful of pebbles. I tossed
   the pebbles down one by one, aimlessly, until at last I had just the
   shilling in my hand. But even as I dropped the coin into my pocket,
   the battle begun. That coin meant I could stay in school. I wouldn't
   be doing Richard a favor by giving it to him: he'd spend it on drink
   and be thirsty as ever in an hour.

   While I was still thinking up excellent arguments, I knew it was no
   good. How could I judge Richard when Christ told me so clearly
   that I must not. Furthermore, this was not the Royal Way! What
   right had an ambassador to hold on to money when another of the
   King's children stood in front of him saying he was hungry? I shoved
   my hand back into my pocket and drew out the silver coin.

   "Look, Richard," I said, "I do have this. Would it help any?"

   Richard's eyes lit up. "It would, mate." He tossed the coin into the
   air and ran off down the hill. With a light heart that told me I had
   done the right thing, I turned to go back inside.

   And before I reached the door the postman turned down our walk.

   In the mail of course was a letter for me. I knew when I saw
   Greetje's handwriting that it would be from the prayer group at
   Ringers' and that there would be cash inside. And there was. A
   lot of money: A pound and a half -- thirty shillings. Far more than
   enough to send my letter, buy a large box of soap, treat myself to
   my favorite toothpaste -- and buy Gillette Supers instead of Blues.
   The game was over. The King had done it His way.

[[
Would Mercuriou really read this entire section of text during
a televised debate?  Seems a little longish.

Yet I do think it livens up the text, and it's a wonderful
story in a wonderful book.

Brother Andrew's still alive; 93 years old at the time of this writing.

I hope he approves of _Icarus_Wing_.
]]

Mercuriou: "1954! 1954! Not 72 A.D.! 'Another of the King's children
stood in front of him saying he was hungry!' That should posted on the
counter of every restaurant in America, not a VISA symbol!"

Zee started thundering from his pulpit.

Zee: "This isn't the Will of God! You're just a bunch of druggies!
This isn't the Will of God! You're just a bunch of druggies! This
isn't the Will of God! You're just a bunch of druggies!"

Zee seemed stuck on a cracked track, so Ecks switched him to standby.

[[
Mercuriou had previously accused Wye of being on a "cracked track"
because she kept asking about "the people".  Now it's Zee who
seems to repeat the same mantra over and over.

My perception of conservative Evangelical Christian leaders, the "religious right"
in the United States, is that they're
stuck on a cracked track about drugs and sex, with a healthy
dose of obedience to wordly authority thrown in for good measure.

People like Brother Andrew are the exception, but then again, he's Dutch.
]]

Ecks: "Well, Captain, you'll be in a prison cell by this time tomorrow
evening.  I'm sure that your plans for Hawaiian secession will go
the way of the Republic of Mars."


T + 391 days    it must be racist

[[
How should Lucy Liberal and ARM get their comeuppance?

While Senator Wye kept asking what "the people" want, Lucy Liberal
is more outraged that a goofball minority
of Christian fanatics would dare step outside their protected
First Ammendment space and actually challenge the government for power.

ARM is an atheist, in this chapter a squawking Richard Dawkins type
moreso than any American politico.

I have no idea if Ms. Ocasio-Cortez or Ms. Hannah-Jones are atheists, and it's
not my intent to imply that they are.  ARM is a fictional character.

It just seems a nice complement to all the political stuff we had in the
last chapter.

When last we saw them, all they talked about was race and all they did was
agree with each other.  Now all they talk about is secularism, and there
is the slightest bit of daylight visible between them - Lucy is agnostic,
while ARM is an atheist.
]]

ARM: "What you are is a dangerous religious fanatic!"

Lucy: "Captain, we've realized over the years that freedom of religion includes freedom _from_ religion..."

ARM: "That's right!  Some of us don't believe there's any God at all!"

Mercuriou: "Some of us believe that there is a God, and it's important to us that our leaders believe that too!"

ARM: "Why, so they can impose their Biblical morality on everyone else?"

Mercuriou: "No, because we believe that prayer is effective and we want leaders who pray to God!"

[[
If prayer is effective, given what we're told about Satan in the Bible,
having a Satanist pray over a borough meeting sounds a little scary to me.

The atheists, of course, don't believe that any of this is real.
]]

ARM: "Which God?  Jesus?  Mohammad?  Vishnu?"

Lucy: "The United States Constitution prohibits religious tests for office..."

Mercuriou: "Demanding that a politican swear to some religious creed is different
from wanting leaders who strive to obey God!"

ARM: "Well, I want leaders who base their decisions on rational, scientific consensus, not prayer to an imaginary diety!"

Mercuriou: "Nobody makes their decisions based on reason and science!
What scientific experiment do you run to decide to get married?
You got some machine that can read the mind of a witness and tell
a judge or a jury if they're lying?
People make most of their decisions based on hunches and feelings, not reason and science,
and athiests are no different."

[[
To me, one of the great atheist frauds is this aura of science
that they cloak themselves in.  I don't think anybody,
atheists included, make their most important decisions based on science.
]]

Lucy: "When we make decisions about things like climate change,
we want those decisions made based on reason and science, not some religion!"

ARM: "And we don't need religion to tell us what our values are!"

Mercuriou: "You got most all of these problems in the first place because you won't
listen to Jesus Christ!"

Lucy: "We got a lot of these problems because of religion, and we're
created a political system that gives people both freedom of
religion, and freedom from religion!"

ARM: "We got these problems because of racism!"

Mercuriou: "Let me suggest a thought experiment, an alternate American South,
where the whites believed they were smarter, faster, stronger, superior
in every way to these primitive African blacks, so they tried to educate
the blacks, made sure they had good schools, mentored them in business..."

ARM: "But always kept them down; never gave them real power!"

Mercuriou: "I don't know; I'm just saying that the brutality of
slavery can't just be explained away as racism!  If you think
someone else is inferior to you, you don't have to chain them
to a plow!  You can help them improve, and that's the way
of love taught by Christ!"

ARM: "We can practice love without praying to some imaginary God
that no rational person would believe in because there's not
a shred of scientific evidence for its existence!"

Mercuriou: "There isn't a shred of scientific evidence for
extraterrestrial life, either!  We've sent probes all over
this solar system, landed men on the Moon, scanned the heavens
for decades looking for some kind of intelligent signal,
and it just isn't there!  You gonna tell me that no
rational person would believe in extraterrestrials either?"

ARM: "The universe is vast, Captain.  Reasonable people
agree that it isn't six thousand years old, either.
It's quite reasonable to think that there's intelligent
life out there, somewhere, unless you want to believe
your Bible that tells you only man was created in God's image!"

Mercuriou: "It's reasonable, but you don't have any
scientific evidence.  That's a lot like the evidence
for God's existence.  Consider something like the Miracle
of the Sun in 1917.  
Consider what happened in Fatima, Portugal in 1917.
Three eight-year-old kids said
they saw a beautiful woman who claimed to be
Mary, the mother of Jesus, and who told them that
she would work a miracle with the Sun in six months
time.  On that day, six months hence, in October 1917, thirty or forty
thousand people witnessed the Sun change colors,
move around in the sky, and appear to spin on its axis!"

ARM: "Well if all those thousands of people were staring
at the Sun, who knows what they might have imagined
to have seen?  It was probably some kind of mass hallucination!
What else are we to believe?  That
the Sun and the Earth were ripped out of their orbits in some way?"

[[
I didn't know much at all about the miracle of the Sun until
I read _The_God_Delusion_.  Dawkins' book really disappointed
me, too.  I was hoping he would make a solid case for atheism,
and I really wanted to read it, but his argument is so full
of holes.  The Miracle of Sun is typical.  ARM is totally
channeling Dawkins here.

The kids were actually 7, 8, and 10 years of ago.  I averaged
the numbers together for the sake of brevity in the novel.
]]


Mercuriou: "I don't think so; it was probably some kind of localized
atmospheric phenomenon.  Some of those eyewitnesses reported
that it didn't hurt their eyes to look at the Sun."

ARM sneered.

ARM: "Then where's the need for a miracle?  If it was just an atmospheric phenomenon?!"

Mercuriou: "Even if it was an atmospheric phenomenon, how did three eight-year-old kids predict
it months in advance; we can't even explain it to this day?!"

Mercuriou: "I think the most likely explaination is that the kids were telling the truth!
They saw a beautiful lady who said she was Mary the mother of Jesus,
and she predicted a future event that we can't explain to this day!"

ARM: "If there were a rational explaination, I'm sure science would find it!", ARM huffed.

Mercuriou: "Sure, just like science will tell us if there are extraterrestrials!"

ARM: "I'm sure science will tell us if there are extraterrestrials!"

Mercuriou: "When, a thousand years from now?"



"So, you think there might not be any other intelligent life in this galaxy, that we're it?"

"It seems unlikely, but it's possible"

"But do you have any _scientfic_ evidence for the existence of exterterrestrial life?
Do you have any expiriment you can run to demonstrate its existance?"

[[
The atheiests will say that the vastness and longevity of the universe is scientific evidence
for the existance of extraterrestrial life, but there's still no direct scientific
experiment that can be run to test for its existance.
]]



Mercuriou: "The majority are convinced that they have the right to rule the world,
and what they want is money and sex.  Just look at what dominates American
society, it's money and sex!  Have a lot of nice toys, lots of entertainment,
everybody's getting laid.  Then throw in capitalism!  It tells people that
what helps the world is for everyone to pursue their own self interest!
By maximizing your profit, you're helping to feed the world!
It's downright evil; it's as evil as Marxism!"



Andrea: "It's the inhumanity of man, Alister, and it transcends race.
India's caste system persists to this day.  When the European
explorers first sailed around the globe, they found human sacrifice
widely practiced throughout the Pacific Islands.  In Mexico,
human sacrifice was the centerpiece of the state religion.
Woman are still severely oppressed in some Muslim countries.
Race is just one of many things people use to justify themselves."

"They bribed them!  They bribed them to betray their own people,
and this is what went on in Africa, too!"

"It's not like the people who have ruled this country have
preached sacrifice for the sake of humanity!  They've
preached enlightened self interest; they've told the
world that the way to feed the masses is for everybody
to get a job, and the elite have made millions for
themselves!  If democracy finally falls, a lot of people
are going to shrug their shoulders and say, 'who cares?'"

Mercuriou: "Well, look what democracy has produced.  Slavery in the United States..."

ARM: "That is not democracy.  We did not have a true democracy at that time!"

Mercuriou: "I'm not buying that.  This country has been a democracy since its
foundation, since before its foundation, in fact!"


...

Mercuriou: "This country has white washed slavery just as the communists would like to white wash the gulag."

Mercuriou: "Nobody blames democracy.  Democracy has produced slavery and segregation
in United States, the armed conquest of both the Native American tribes and the fledgling
Republic of Mexico; democracy brought Robespierre and his guillotine to power in Frace;
Napoleon Bonaparte rose to power in that same democracy; we saw elections bring Hitler
to power in Germany..."

...

Alister: "Isn't their show still going on?  What are they talking about without you?"

Mercuriou turned the video feed back on.

ARM: "...the anti-Blackness of this mission!"

Lucy: "Captain Mercuriou has returned to our broadcast..."

ARM: "It would be more accurate to say that we've returned to his!"

Lucy: "He conducted this sham exit where he switched himself off..."

ARM: "Why are minority voices being silenced on this mission!?"

[[
She's being silenced because she won't let her opposition speak,
but she claims that its because she's Black.  I do see that
pattern repeated in progressive circles - behavior with
a non-racist cause is labeled racist by changing its cause.
]]

Lucy: "I'm just outraged by this notion that people don't have the right to choose their own leaders!"

Mercuriou: "Only the majoirty has the right to choose the leaders!  The majority rules over everyone!
Only the majority chooses the leaders!"

Lucy: "Minorities can peacefully protest!  Those protests have netted us our
greatest advances in women's rights, race relations, LGBT rights..."

Mercuriou: "The only rights you've got are the ones the majority gives you.
Most of those protests were ignored and opposed until the majority
of people changed their minds."

Mercuriou: "It's the old plantation story," and here Mercuriou fell into
an immitation of a Black slave, an 'Uncle Tom'.

[[
Oxford Languages (via Google): an Uncle Tom is "a black man
considered to be excessively obedient or servile to white people".
]]

Mercuriou: "Yes sir, massa.  I'm jest here to make a petition, massa.
Whatever massa decides, yes sir, massa."




So kind of racism, if you want to call it that, is natural.  People
generally like people who look like them.  Just as some form of
sexism is normal; kids can tell the difference between boys
and girls.  Some form of communism is common in the context
of a couple or a family.

"I'm not a racist, because I don't believe in racism, just like
I'm not a communist because I don't believe in communism."

ARM: "But you live in a racist society, you take advantage of
the structures of racism without even being conscious of it!"

"Yes, but I live in a capitalist society and I have taken
advantage of capitalism, but I don't think anybody would
describe me as a capitalist!"

"I'm not a capitalist because I don't believe in capitalism,
and I'm not a racist because I don't believe in racism."

ARM: "But you've said you do believe in racism! You think
people just naturally favor people who look like them!"

Mercuriou: "Yes, but I don't believe that one race is superior to
others, or has some right to rule over others.  I _do_
think we all need to guard ourselves against our own
biases.  A foreigner who speaks heavily accented English
might speak it better than I speak _any_ foreign language,
and I should remember that when my bias tell me that he's stupid!"

"Progressives rail against Christopher Columbus because they say he
came to conquer and exploit the Americas!  But what the Spaniards
found in Mexico was the Aztec civilization that practiced not
only slavery, but human sacrifice as well!  What would the
progressives have done?  Would you respect Aztec civilization
any more than you respect people who won't use the right pronoun?"

ARM: "Maybe that's what they found in Mexico, but in the Caribbean
they established a slave empire as brutal as the one established
here under English rule!"

Mercuriou: "There's no shortage of oppression in human history!
India had the caste system.  World War Two Japanese were told
their race was destined to rule the world.  Human sacrifice
was practiced not only in Mexico, but throughout Polynesia.
And need we mention the Soviet Gulag or the Nazi death camps?"

ARM: "Nazism was driven by a white racist ideology!"

Lucy: "In all those cases, it is democracy that has overcome
these oppressive ideologies!"

Mercuriou: "Democracy also produced many of them!  England
was a slave trading democracy, and so was the United States..."

Lucy: "These were sham democracies in which half of the people could not vote!"

Mercuriou: "They were populist!  They weren't ruled by a king!
All the white men got together and the majority of them decided they
wanted slavery!"

ARM: "The _white_men_!  The _white_men_!"

ARM: "This is racism!  This is flat-out, unashamed racism!
You only like people who look like you;
you blame democracy for the white man's evil;
you lead this white crew on this white Christian secessionist mission!
This is racism!  This is racism!"

Finally, Mercuriou through the switch.  He bowed his head briefly
in the silent cabin, then opened the door and returned to the crew area.

[[
Just after launch, a cocky grinning Mercuriou taunted his opponents and finally
threw the switch.  Nothing happened.  Now, a somber and serious
Mercuriou throws the switch and... his opponents are silenced
since the the dialog now continues on the spaceship!
]]

Mercuriou: "I just can't get a word in edgewise with those two."

%% Alister: "There's a lot of racism still in my country."

[[
I travelled around northwestern Europe for almost a month with the "real" Alister,
but never bothered to ask him about race in his country.
Never really thought about it!  That's too bad, because
he probably could have given me some nice stories to
put here in the novel.
]]

Andrea showed them a diagram she had drawn:

DIAGRAM
          White Men       Everyone Else

Good         < 50%            ?

Evil         > 50%            ?

Andrea: "The only way you can believe this, and also
believe that the majority are good, is to believe that the white man is a
lot more evil than everyone else."



T + 393 days    it must be strange

[[
Andrea's dream about Alaska.  Why is it here?  Because the political
program proposed for Hawai'i could just as easily work in Alaska.
That's it.  That's all.  That's what this chapter "means".

Like most writing, it's
semi-autobiographical.  Of course I did most of that!  How
else could I have written about it in such detail?  My
imagination isn't that good.
]]

"Dr. Yeats?"

Andrea looked up from the airline magazine she was reading.

Andrea: "Yes?"

"Would you like to visit the flight deck?"

Andrea: __Kyle__! "I'd love to!"

Andrea unfastened her seatbelt and followed the flight attendant to
the jetliner's cockpit, where a warm welcome greated her.
She shook the hands of both pilots, then settled into the jump seat,
fell silent, and started gazing out the window at
the night sky, which was starting to glow red across the horizon to the plane's right.
The pilots engaged in some radio chatter.

[[
First, she thought Kyle Lankier had invited her forward,
then he's never mentioned again.  This is deliberate;
it's a dream, and she's forgotten all about him a moment later.
]]

"Oceanic clearance via waypoints TIN CITY, NORTHWAY, ICE POOL, SIVUQAQ, then direct ANCHORAGE."

[[
Believe it or not, these are all actual aviation waypoint names
in Alaska, but they're scattered all over the place.
I especially like having a native village right before Anchorage,
so I picked Sivuqaq because I've been there on a mission trip
to help the village build a new church.  It's on St. Lawrence
Island, 35 miles from the Russian coast, and, proximity
to land notwithstanding, is the most remote community I've ever
been to in my life.

"Oceanic clearance" because I imagine the flight coming from Hawaii.
]]

By five am, Andrea was walking along the airport's
glass windowed concourse, marveling at the sun now 30 degrees above the horizon.
Then came her connecting flight.  As she deplaned again,
she saw a priest greeting another man.  Was there a connection?

[[
Q: How can it be 30 degrees above the horizon a half hour after sunrise?
A: it's a dream

Yet in Alaska, it can sure be well above the horizon by five am.

The priests were real; I saw them the first time I deplained in Juneau.
I should have to walked over and introduced
myself, but they were total strangers, so I walked on.  I would
have liked to have known the one priest better; I did met him eventually,
but he died shortly thereafter.

Take what God gives you.
]]

Somehow she got a ride downtown.  Was there a bus?  The town
was nestled between a mountain and a wide channel of
water.  Trees loomed over everything; there was some kind of tramway.
Metal staircases sometimes took the place of sidewalks.

[[
The first time I arrived in Juneau, I probably hitchhiked
into town from the airport, but I only vaguely remember
the ride.  I don't think I took the bus.

Juneau's between Mount Roberts and the Gastineau Channel,
the Mount Roberts Tramway runs from sea level to
the plateau, and the metal staircases were built
because the town is quite hilly and it ices
up in the winter.
]]

Then it was dinner time and she was at a homeless shelter.

[[
The _Glory_Hole_.  I didn't name it.  The allusion is
to mining, prominent in Alaskan history, not to anything sexual.
]]

"What kind of weird sex thing you trying to pull?  You were siting in there wearing nothing but your panties!"

Andrea: "I don't know what you're talking about!  I just got here!"

"You can get the hell outta here, is what you can do!"

[[
Something like that happened to me.  It wasn't my first night in Juneau,
but maybe within the first week.  I got up on a Sunday morning,
put on a shorts and a T-shirt, walked through an open door with
no sign on it, sat down in a chair and starting reading my Bible.
One of the staff came in and told me I had to leave, that it
was a restricted area.  That night I was thrown out of the
mission by the night manager, who hadn't been there, but
had heard somehow that I was in the staff area in only
my underwear, thus setting in motion all of the events
of Andrea's dream.
]]

Andrea took her bedroll and trudged out into the night.  She followed
a road until the pavement ended, then she was walking over wooden
planks and a bridge over a raging creek and a dirt road that continued up the mountain
until it ended at a clearing with old mining equipment scattered
about and nothing but a trail continued on.  The place was deserted,
so she walked a short way back down the road, then climbed
up the wooded slope and laid down to sleep.

It began to rain, a cold, driving rain, accessory to an already
chilly night.  Soaking wet, she trudged back down to
the bridge and followed a trail that led down alongside the rushing creek.
Eventually she came to a building
that offered some shelter from the rain, and she
settled down in her wet clothes to await the dawn.
The rain kept coming down on her no matter how she sat.
Finally, she dozed off...

[[
It's Basin Road, Perserverance Trail, and Gold Creek in Juneau,
and it all pretty much happened like that.

I kinda messed around with the grammar a bit to try and
make it seem at least a little dream-like.
]]

..and awoke with a start.  She was in her usual sleeping
compartment onboard _Xplorer_One_, but her sleeping bag was
soaking wet and ice cold.  A water line had burst
a leak and slowly inundated her with cold water as she slept.
As she cleaned up the mess, she slowly turned the
strange dream over and over in her mind.

[[
I could drag this description on for a bit, and maybe
I should, but the point of the chapter has been made.
]]


T + 394 days    it must be anti-Semitic

NASA had arranged for the _Xplorer_One_ crew to transfer to the space
shuttle _Columbus_ at the end of a two week scientific mission notable
for including the first Palestinian astronaut, Major Hasan Nass, of
Hamas.  The shuttle commander, Jeff Janders, had know Andrea for
years.

alNass: "Sal\=amu `Alaykum", Nass greeted Mercuriou fervently,
kissing both his cheeks after shaking his hand during introductions,
then helping the _Xplorer_One_ crew stow their personal belongings in the
attached Spacehab.

[[
It's an Arabic greeting.

I hope.
]]

alNass: "You'll be fine in here.  The Spacehab's got the same life
support as the cabin."

[[
Nass is the Arabic word for "people", as in "the people" (alnass)

As Andrea will soon ask, "where did I find this guy"?

Earlier drafts of the novel featured the crew returning via the
International Space Station (still with the same shuttle disaster)
where they met an old friend of Andrea's, the Russian cosmonaut
Borsov, named, if I recall, after the mission commander in Clarke's _Rama_II_.
Borsov was an old school communist who gave us some unapologetic
Marxism to go with his vodka shots and boisterous charm.

(all of this, incidentally, should be in the novel's
version history on github)

At this point, I still planned to interview the _Columbia_'s crew
surviving family to portray them accurately in the novel.  It was
apparant to me that not only was this infeasible, but it might cause problems,
say, if they objected to the actual crew being portrayed in the novel at all.

So I was already working on an alternate ending when the shuttle's
name would be changed and its crew replaced with fictional characters.

What, however, to do with Colonel Ramon?

Replacing the world's first Israeli astronaut with the first world's
Palestinian astronaut seemed most consistent with the overall tone
of the novel.  Borsov got mixed in with Nass and the alternate
ending gradually became the prime ending.

After the events of the last three decades (1990-2020), from the collapse
of the Soviet Union to the War on Terror, how apropos
it now seems to replace a red Bolshevik with a screaming
Islamic fanatic!
]]

Another old friend of Andrea's was payload specialist David Smith, but
he had not greeted her as warmly, and seemed rather aloof.  When they
were alone for a minute, she found out why.

David: "We're not making it back from this mission, Andrea."

Andrea: "What are you talking about?"

David: "I've had dreams... nightmares... burning up in space."

[[
David Smith and Story Musgrave are the only real astronauts,
and in fact the only real people, to appear in the novel.
I do believe I've read that Smith had premonitions of
the _Columbia_ disaster, though I couldn't verify that,
so I decided to include him
and his dreams.
]]

After both crews enjoyed a dinner of rehydrated lobster bisque,
Major Nass sailed over to the galley, opened his personal compartment,
and pulled out two pouches containing two clear liquids.
Somehow, he turned so that the
green, red and black striped flag on his right shoulder seemed more
noticeable than before.

[[
Lobster bisque, I've read, is a food introduced perhaps on the
Apollo missions?  Or maybe it didn't make it into orbit until Skylab,
but I remember reading it was actual 1970s-era astronaut food.

The drink is called arak.  According to wikipedia, it is the traditional
alcoholic beverage in Palestine.
]]

alNass: "Captain, you may live the rest of your life as a dog in an
American kennel, but tonight we celebrate like men."

Nass joined the two drink pouches together and squeezed the one
to inject its contents into the other, which transformed
into a milkey white liquid.
Andrea raised an eyebrow as Nass distributed the liquor
using smaller drink bags filled with ice.

[[
There really is some preparation like this when consuming arak;
see the wikipedia article.  The way I've got it doped out,
you'd have to do something like this to serve arak properly in space.
]]

Andrea: "Just out of curiosity, major, what would be the Muslim
solution to the _Xplorer_One_ theft?"

alNass: "Cut off your hands?"

The Americans guffawed, and Jeff Janders fired back.

Janders: "Most Americans would consider that cruel and unusual punishment."

alNass: "So what if it is?  Is the loss of a hand too great a price
to pay for freedom?  Let's ask the criminal - Captain
Mercuriou, which would you prefer - to lose your hand, no, let's make it
both hands - one for the billion dollar theft and one for getting your friends killed -
both hands off or spend your life in prison!?"

The cabin fell silent as Mercuriou surveyed the surrounding faces.

Mercuriou: "I think I'd give the hands very serious consideration."

Now it was Nass's turn to explode in glee.

alNass: "You see!  And we don't waste our money on so many jails!"

Several of the Americans began to object simultaneously, but Nass
ignored them, appropriated for himself the remaining arak, for that is the
name of the drink, and next produced
a bowl of Hawai'ian "kine"!

[[
Not only another bit of drug use, but another Hawaiian allusion!
]]

alNass: "More to your taste, Captain?"

Mercuriou: "Thank you."

After the space captain has taken his first "hit" in over a year,
he turned back to Nass.

Mercuriou: "I take it you're a fan?"

The Palestinian major sneered.

alNass: "A fan!?  I listened to your speech.  You're still talking
about 'freedom'!"

alNass: "What is your freedom?!  Money, sex, guns!  Get rich on Wall
Street!  Change yourself into a woman!  The most devastating killing
machines ever devised by man, for sale to all of your friends!  Ask
the people of Gaza what 'freedom' has done for them!"

Jeff Janders had trained with Hasan Nass for a year, had endured two weeks
on orbit with the cocky and flamboyant major, had just witnessed him
producing and consuming first alcohol and then marijuana in flight, and was not about to back
down in an argument now.

Janders: "The people of Israel can vote..."

alNass: "The people of Israel can not vote!  With their racist Aliyah,
Israel is as much a democracy as South Carolina was in 1860!  Let
every Jew come back and vote, and let every Arab come back and vote,
too.  Then let's have an election!  Then let's see who wins!
Mercuriou's right.  What does he call it, a 'game show government'?  You
define your majority how you want, then you get your elections how you want, too."

Janders: "We do not define the majority how we want.  The majority is defined by
law."

alNass: "Who wrote the law?  The Jews!  Obviously non-citizens can not
vote.  Clearly the State of Israel can establish its own citizenship
requirements.  You think it's all so cut and dry."

Andrea: "...and what happens if Hamas takes over?  War until
Israel is destroyed?  Then what happens to the Jews?"

The cabin again fell silence as Nass bowed his head and assumed a reverent posture.

alNass: "May the will of Allah be done."

The shuttle commander practically exploded.

Janders: "You call that a prayer!  I'll bet it was real popular in those Christian churches in South Carolina, too!"

alNass: "You own religion is not free from blood, Jeff!  We've been
fighting you Infidels since Urban the Second sent us the first
Crucade!  This war between us has now gone on over a thousand years!"

Andrea: "If your forefathers were seeking Jesus, they would have
been better served to look for Him in the monasteries of Egypt rather
than in the armies landing at Tyre!"

alNass: "The desert lands are ours!  Arabs will rule the desert if takes ten thousand years!"

Andrea: "I'm sorry, what is your party again?"

alNass: "I'm a radical Islamic nationalist, of course!"

[[
There is no such party (that I'm aware of), but an "Islamic nationist" is meant to
sound as self-contradictory as a "communist nationalist",
since communism preaches a global proletarian movement.
]]

Andrea: "But I thought Islam was open to the whole world, not just to Arabs?"

alNass glared at his American nemesis, then looked to the bag of arak,
which was nearly empty.  He bolted down a final slug, then shifted gears.

alNass: "All these people sing your hymns, talk about Jesus, loving
the poor, forgiving their enemies, and then they go to work in a war
factory.  Why?"

Andrea sighed deeply.

Andrea: "I've tried to stay away from war factories, personally."

alNass: "But the people who work there, don't they believe in Jesus?
Aren't they saved?  They're going to heaven, right?"

Andrea paused again.

Andrea: "I don't know.  Not all of them.  Maybe not any of them.  I just don't know."

alNass: "How many people on our side believe in Allah the same way?"

Janders: "What I'd like to know is why are you one of them?"

alNass: "I?  One of them?"

Janders: "Yes, why do you advocate for war?"

alNass: "Advocate for war?  I am here as an emassary of peace!  A symbol of the unity
between the people of the United States of America and those of the Palestinian Authority!
As well as the only man on this spacecraft to welcome this condemned criminal with
a modicum of grace!"

Janders: "Then why do you hate so Jews and infidels?"

alNass: "Because they're finished!  _Finished_!  The Jews
are _finished_!  The third temple must be destroyed!  Islam will rule
again in Jerusalem!"

[[
In Nass's mind, Islam is destined to rule
the world and all non-believers will live under Islamic rule,
which is also conveniently Arab rule.
]]

Andrea leaned close to Janders and whispered in his ear.

Andrea:  "Where did you find this guy?"

The shuttle commander shrugged.

Janders: "Beats me.  They told us he was a moderate."

alNass: "A moderate!  I am a moderate!  If I were a radical, I'd have
C-4 instead of caviar in my flight kit!"

[[
Jews will be offended that I've replaced one of their national heros
with this goofball.  Palestinians will be offended by their portrayal
as screaming Islamic fanatics, with the distinction between radicals
and moderates being only whether or not they endorse terrorism.
Americans will be offended by turning the _Columbia_ tragedy into
a punch line.

I'm not trying to offend anyone!  I'm just trying to give
you a good ending to the novel, and this is the best I could
come up with.

Was _Candide_ offensive?  _The_Satanic_Verses_?  The nature
of satire is to mock opposing philosophies; of course
people find it offensive.  I could pull my punches,
but it wouldn't be as good a read.
]]

T + 395 days    some sick "freedom" must win in the end

On the big island of Hawai'i, the seaside town of Hilo had somehow turned into
ground zero for a revolution.  Disappointed hipsters, turned away at
the razor-wire fence that still sealed off the abandoned launch
facility at South Point, had travelled on up the Hawai'i Belt Road,
cruised past Volcanoes National Park and descended on Hilo,
which until now had been mostly known for having its downtown
devastated by a tsunami forty years before.  Tent camps had sprung up
in the beach parks, surrounded by signs calling for revolution and
independence, while those few European tourists lucky enough to have
reservations at the youth hostel found their vacation wiped out by
Americians debating politics until well after midnight.

It was nearly four o'clock in the morning in Hilo when _Columbus_
whizzed by overhead, now well into its retry phase.  As it burned
through the Pacific sky at 2,600 degrees, three astronauts chatted in
the Spacehab at a cool 72.

Mercuriou: "You know, Andrea, before launch we gathered everyone
together below the nose cone and I gave everyone a chance to propose
a name for this vessel that was to launch us on this great journey!
...Everyone except you, that is!  What would you have called our vessel?
What would have named our mission?"

As she sank deep into thought, _Columbus_ slashed across the California
coastline at Mach 23.  Two time zones swept past in the span of time it
took to ask and answer a question; by the time Andrea spoke, it was six a.m.

Andrea: "_The_Royal_Way_."

[[
Hmmm.  Orbital speed is about 90 minutes per orbit, 24 time zones,
so figure about 4 minutes per time zone.  Did it really take her
eight minutes to answer a question?  Artistic license.
]]

Mecuriou leaned back in his pressure suit and silently contemplated
what she could possibly mean.

Three thousand miles east, NASA's primary landing facility at Cape
Canaveral's Kennedy Spaceflight Center had been transformed into an
armed camp.  What with the usual tight security surrounding a space
shuttle launch or landing, the FBI also being on hand to take one
Marcelious Mercuriou into custody along with diplomatic contingents
from both the South African embassy and the Palestinian Authority.
Security guards holding assault rifles.

Protesters picketed both for and against Mercuriou at a "free speech"
zone ten miles away.  His opponents had adopted an electric bolt
to symbolize their desired punishment for the space captain, while others
held signs that read "MERCURIOU FOR PRESIDENT",
along with "FREE ALISTER", and "SMOKE POT AND READ YOUR BIBLE".

[[
The American government has, in recent years, taken to establishing
"free speech" zones at some distance from major political conventions.

Shouldn't his name be Alistair?

I first thought of a using a noose instead of an electric bolt, but
decided to drop it because of its racial connotations.  About the
only punch I've pulled throughout the novel.

"SMOKE POT AND READ YOUR BIBLE" is a sign that Timothy Shouts
suggested for evangelism, and that I've used myself on occasion.  There's
plenty of pictures of me and the sign on social media from San Jose State's 2012
homecoming.  It's a little bit reminiscent of "BONG HITS 4 JESUS",
and it's here to satirize protests that become a platform
for all kinds of screwball messages.
]]

Meanwhile, in the cockpit, the flight crew was studying a tire
pressure warning as Major Nass took imaginary pistol shots at the
American cities passing below in the brightening dawn.

alNass: "There's an infidel!  Boom! ... There's an infidel!  Boom!"

David Smith shushed him down.

David_alNass_David: "There's a problem..." "What!?" "There's a problem with the _shuttle_!"

[[
Yes!  Finally!  _Shut_up_!
]]

Nass fell silent, his attention now riveted on the drama unfolding before him.

Janders: "Does it look like instrumentation?"

Pilot MeGee checked his avionics console again.

McGee: "No way.  It's solid.  Our left rear tires are blown."

Janders: "Now the left gear is showing a barber pole...  We're getting
a lot of aileron trim, too."

[[
There was no cockpit voice recorder.  I like to imagine that
the flight crew was sharp as a tack and right on top of the situation.
]]

The shuttle lurched to one side as a chunk of the left wing broke off,
then the autopilot recovered.

McGee: "What was that?"

Janders: "Another weird shimmy."

Next the radio crackled to life.

Radio: "_Columbus_, Houston, we see your tire pressure messages and we did
not copy your last."

Janders ignored "CAPCOM", instead pointing to the small yellow lights
that indicated RCS thruster activity.

Janders_McGee_Janders: "How long's that been on?"  "What?"  "That!"

The right yaw light was lit solid.

Back in the Spacehab, Mercuriou had given up.

Mercuriou: "Andrea, what do you mean, _The_Royal_Way_?  What, what does that mean?"

Andrea Yeats looked him straight in the eye.

Andrea: "It's Christ's way."

[[
The allusion is to Andrew van der Bijl, aka Brother Andrew.  In his biography
_God's_Smuggler_, he talks lot about the Royal Way.
]]

Suddenly, the orbiter gave a sickening lurch and a warbling two-tone alarm pierced the air.

Andrea: "That's a Master Alarm!"

She glanced down at her status display.

Andrea: "We've lost hydraulics!"

The g-forces that had pinned them against the wall a moment ago
vanished and the shuttle began to roll and sway as it careened through
the air, uncontrolled now by man or machine.

Mercuriou: "Tight up!", Mercuriou barked.

Mercuriou and Andrea needed only to snap their visors shut to get
"tight", but Alister's gloves were off.  As he started to don his left
glove, he looked up and caught Burns' eye.  The engineer was floating
leisurely in the middle of the Spacehab, dressed in a casual pair of
slacks.  His ubiquitous T-shirt read "DON'T BOTHER".  Vic was there, too.

[[
The _Columbia_ accident investigation board concluded that at least
one of the _Columbia_ crewmembers were not wearing their gloves
during reentry.
]]

Mercuriou: "Vic?!  W-what?  You're..."

Vic: "So are you, Marc."

The orbiter was now swaying wildly up and down in a phugoid motion,
exposing the top of the fuselage to the direct heat of re-entry once
every few seconds.  They heard a loud crash and felt something break
loose from the tail.

Burns: "There was a piece of frozen foam insulation that broke off the ET
during launch... smashed a pretty good hole in the leading edge of the
left wing, right through all that protective heat shielding."

Burns' words were punctuated by a ear-splitting crack, like half a
pound of linguine snapped in half in front of a microphone.  The cabin
pitched to the side as the entire cargo bay ripped away from the
forebody and the access tunnel torn loose from the crew module.  Only
a strip of aluminum skin was left connecting _Columbus_ together.
Then that, too, tore free, and the orbiter had split in two.

The power went out, but they were not long in darkness.  The
forward bulkhead began to glow a deep, ominous red.

Vic: "This is a pretty good way to go, Marc.  Quick, but a bit painful.
Say goodbye to Burns."

[[
Is is "quick, but a bit painful"?  From a spiritual perspective,
it's far quicker than cancer, or diabetes, or AIDS, quicker than
recovering from major brain damage or blinding injury.

Mortals might think it's rather slow to be steamed alive in a spacesuit, though.

NASA seems to think that the trama of the capsule breaking up (think car crash times ten) would kill
before you get steamed alive in a sealed spacesuit until its burns apart.  I don't know.
The pressure suits they wear for reentry might not be that fire-resistant (witness Apollo One),
but I don't think that an actual spacesuit would just "vaporize to ashes".
]]

Mercuriou: "Why?"

Burns: "I wasn't saved."

The bulkhead blazed white, then morphed into a wave of flame that
broke over them, a crushing, foaming ten foot wall of raging red
surf that buried them under an ocean of fire and slammed them onto a bed
of coals.  They were burning, Burning, BURNING!! and then their suits
vaporized to ashes which blew away with the flames and left them
hanging in an azure haze.

[[
An allusion to wiping out on a big wave while surfing, like
when I bungled a moderate-sized wave at
Al'i beach park when I was living in Haleiwa and working on the
novel in 2011.  Found myself slammed onto a bed of sand, fortunately, not coals.
]]

_Columbus_ was gone, replaced with a thousand blazing brushes painting
fire on sky.  Then Burns was gone, too, and they were clothed in white
robes.  Of the shuttle crew, only David remained, and he too was
clothed in white.  Below them lay America, above them space, and above
space blazed a stupendous light.

[[
Why only David remains of the shuttle crew?

Well, all the rest were fictional characters.

It seems approriate that story is bookended by the only two actual
astronauts to appear; Story Musgrave in the novel's first scene
and David Smith here.
]]

Alister: "Wh-what!?  That's it!?"

Mercuriou turned to him as the earth, the sun, the galaxy fell away beneath
them.

%Mercuriou: "This isn't the beginning; this isn't the end.  This is the Great
%Conversation."

Mercuriou: "There is no beginning; there is no end.  This is the Great
Conversation."

[[
Again, as I explained at the start of the novel, the allusion is to Mortimer Adler and the Great Books.
The Great Conversation is the conversation among authors over the centuries.

Is there a beginning to the Great Conversation?  If so, it's been
lost to history; all we have left are those writings that remain extanct.
Is there an end?  Only if humanity itself ceases to exist.

Every generation, every "great" author
adds their own voice and the conversation continues,
and the test of "greatness" is whether you add something
new and significant to the Great Conversation.

I hope it wasn't too confusing.
