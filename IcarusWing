T - 691 days    crime must pay

It was a brilliant hack.  It topped the one
in college, when the net-news server was
configured to refuse the student lab.
They'd recompiled the server, altered so
that after printing ACCESS 5 DENIED
the program would accept posts anyway,
went in as "root", dropped the raw binary
straight to the drive, and used it daily for
six months until the system staff updated
the whole install.  But then they were just kids.

Burns parked in the employee lot, behind
the water fountain's dancing white froth display
and meter-high "Chesapeake," the k's
back cast a sailboat's mast, and its whole visage that
of whitecaps breaking on the bay.

Chesapeake Computer Corporation:
world's largest router manufacturer,
A-list stock darling of the dot-com-ers,
high priesthood of the Internet who built
sleek metal semaphores humming away
on backroom metal racks of I S Ps
around the world, that same one-word logo
emblazoned on the case of every one.

He strolled into the lobby like a favorite son
into his father's restaurant, breezed
past the rock garden and the potted palms,
blew off the break room, its Phillie cream cheese
bagels and stocked 'fridge, jogged right at the conference rooms
and entered a two-story cave
partitioned by a hundred cubicles -
his life, ten hours a day the last six months.
These steel and fabric walls held Chesapeake's
true wealth, the coddled technocrats who built
the company's flagship products from caffeine
and white-board markers.  Wisely management
consigned itself across the street.

The key card was real; Burns was totally
legit.  A roaring economic boom
kept restaurants, book stores, golf courses and concert halls
jam packed with twenty-somethings who
had never flown economy in their
lives.  Every other car on College Avenue
was a Mercedes, or a B M W,
or a Land Rover.  Chic
restaurateurs provided their patrons colored Crayons and
blank paper place-mats to
brainstorm slick new proprietary server architectures while
waiting for twenty dollar lunches.  Programmers
were hot, and Burns' qualifications made
him a genuine find.
A white board talk was his job interview;
the background check, his resume.
He quickly got the run of Chesapeake,
concerned far more with the next million-dollar order than
deploying any real security against an inside hack.

Today, the cubicles were largely deserted.  As
he slipped into his, an attractive femme
in 'business casual' race-walked past.
A product specialist skilled in trade show acronyms,
Samantha Pride was always ready to
remind "her" programmers the obvious.
When Burns had quit this job, he would not miss
_Top_of_the_morning,_Burns, or
_Big_talk_today,_Burns, or
_Got_a_cable_loose,_there,_Burns, or

"System goes down today, Burns!"

Burns: "Wouldn't miss it for judgement day,"
he muttered back without turning around,
propelled his chair against the terminal stand,
bit back his anxiety and logged in.
The main development computer, scheduled for
a hardware upgrade, would be shut down in less than an hour.
His e-mails, mostly notes from various employees turning the
day's outage into an excuse for a holiday weekend, offered
no reason to change plans.
He logged out, shouldered his laptop case
and headed for the server room.

Back in the early 70s, those halcyon
days when spam came in cans and porn
sites were on Gay Street, Brian Kernighan,
inventor of the UNIX system, demonstrated that a compiler,
the program which converts source code into
the bits and bytes that actually run the machine,
could alter covertly the programs it compiled.
What's more, if the compiler is itself compiled
(and who would write a compiler from scratch?),
a virus is born, propagating from one
compiler version to the next,
altering programs at will
and effectively disappearing in the billions of
bits on a hard drive.  A Kerninghan virus is particularly
effective on closed, heavily customized systems, like those of
a router manufacture wanting custom, proprietary software to take
advantage of custom, proprietary hardware.

Burns slid his key card through the slotted box.
A light turned green,
a bolt clicked back,
a line printer rattled.
Above an elevated floor that covered a halon
fire extinguisher system were floor-to-ceiling arrays
loaded with switch hubs, firewalls, RAID arrays,
and a 10,000-BTU air conditioner to dissipate the heat.
A brand new multi-processor system sat, unpowered and silent,
while
several workers chatted leisurely amonst themselves,
including one sporting a shock of red hair.

"Hey, Burns, what's up?"

'Red' Rimdew specialized in diving into stalled projects and finishing
them by pounding out code.  Burns, really more a designer than a
programmer, respected Red for his staying power with the boring tedium
that the finicky machines imposed on their masters.  Yet today no
deadlines loomed...

"Want to hit the bay?"

An afternoon of sailing on Red's thirty-six-foot Catalan
was an enticing idea.
So were the weeks
spent designing and writing his laptop's "screensaver";
the hours spent drilling 
dozens of varients on a thirty-second procedure; the flowcharted contingency
plans on an encrypted hard drive; his roommate waiting at the
apartment with a network link and two phone lines.

Burns: "No, thanks," Burns replied without a hint of deceit in his
voice.  "I gotta get this done."

He crossed to the other side of the room, where he was working on a
tricky install in one of the test machines.  Somehow, he just couldn't
seem to get the settings right.  Once set up, he emailed his roommate,
"How about lunch?"  _I'm_in_the_server_room._ "Sounds fine," came the
reply.  _Everything's_go!_

Forty five minutes later, with the main system shut down and two of
the three techs out of the room, Burns sent another email, "Let's try
Bogart's."  Back in the apartment, Marc Mercuriou skimmed down a list
of local restaurants and the names they translated into, then picked
up the phone.  A minute later, the third tech was called out to answer
a phone call.  Burns had contemplated taking a shot of J.D. that
morning to steal himself for this moment, but decided that he had to
be absolutely sober in case _anything_ went wrong.

He race-walked [DUP] across the room as the door closed.  It was one
of the scenarios he had drilled for.  He connected two cables, hit a
three-key sequence on the laptop, and ventured a glance at the door.
Nobody.  The laptop beeped.  He disconnected both cables and dashed
back across the room.  It would become one of the world's most
infamous hacks.  It had taken less than 15 seconds.

"Forget Bogart's; let's go for Vacarro's!" he emailed
Mercuriou, who read the message with a wry smile that soon broke into
a broad grin as he began spinning in his chair and cackling like a
demon.

Buoyed by adrenaline, Burns floated back out to the parking lot,
tossed the laptop in the back seat, fired up a sneak-a-toke designed
to look like a cigarette, cranked the tunes and floored the rag-top
all the way home.


T - 370 days    drugs must be promoted

Mercuriou: "The routers run the network; hell the routers _are_ the
network.  You control the routers, you control the network.  You're
God.  I'm telling you, this thing's like super-hack."

A silence fell, sharp and sudden, punctuated by a single word from the
kitchen.

Vic: "Burns."

From his perch on the couch, Mercuriou nodded in assent.  In his early
thirties and a shade under six feet tall [IMPROVE], he was
indifferently clad.  What differentiated him more was his refusal to
allow a television into the apartment; an hour each day, timed on a
stopwatch, devoted to reading Latin; a framed letter of rejection from
the University of Chicago.  Victor Antonov, waiting for a teakettle to
boil, was nearly ten years older, heavy set with a bristling mustache
that often covered a mischevious smile.

Vic: "So what's the point?  Why?"

Mercuriou: "We're going to Mars."

Antonov furled his brows and looked at him like he had just claimed to
have discovered extraterrestrial life.  Mercuriou stared back
impassively, his heart racing.  No, he was serious.  Walking into the
living room, Vic had to return to the kitchen for teabags, as the mugs
contained nothing but hot water.  Meanwhile, Mercuriou had launched
into a prepared speech.

Mercuriou: "Burns' got a plan, and I think it'll work.  Spaceflight is
perfectly doable, that's been demonstrated over and over for almost
fifty years, The problem is money, hell, the problem is always money.
You can't fly without money, you can't ride without money, no money
means no electricity, no house, no food, hell, they sell bottled water
now for a dollar a pop and half the planet can't drink the crap that
comes out of the tap, next thing'll be bottled air, you won't be able
to breath without money!"

Mercuriou: "Well, now we've got money," he concluded his cynical
tirade, produced a pack of fifty-dollar bills and fanned them on the
table, a deck of power.  Vic stood in the doorway holding something
forgotten.

Mercuriou: "Let's just say that there are some Keno systems out there
that are no longer completely random."

Vic: "Marc, this isn't like you, you're not a thief."

Mercuriou: "Well, maybe I've changed."

Vic looked straight into his eyes.  He had changed, as all men do.
Yet now he switched his tone of voice to that of a teenager stammering
to explain a 2 A.M. party to his parents.

Mercuriou: "I'm going to Mars, Vic!  I need the money!"

Vic sighed, handed one of the mugs to his young friend and sat down.

Mercuriou: "They're gonna catch me, Vic.  It's just a matter of time.
I'm into too much money.  I gotta be gone... like _really_ gone!"

Vic: "Mars, huh... Did you steal the money to go or are you going
because you stole the money?..."

Mercuriou didn't answer.  Couldn't answer.

Vic: "Why are you doing this, Marc?  What's it all about... really?"

Finally, they went for a walk.

They walked out into the high summer of the New Mexico mountains, hot
and dry, a day that made the Latin scholar wish for a convertible, a
surf board, and the P.C.H, before Southern California had turned into
a game of Sim City.  They were at the end of a long driveway that
wound between a fifty-foot cliff rising to the left and a dry riverbed
on the right.  He paused and inhaled deeply, saving the aroma of
desert flora.  _Warm_smell_of_colitas,_rising_up_through_the_air...

Vic lead him around the back of the trailer, down a dirt path through
the scrub to the door of a second trailer some distance away.  It
looked much like the first one, except that all of the window curtains
were drawn.  Closer inspection revealed that white drywall backed the
curtains, making it impossible to see in or out.  Vic used a key to
take a padlock off the door and led the way in.

An overwealming smell hit Mercuriou - skunk.  Inside, the trailer had
been stripped of its original furniture and fixtures.  The main room,
some thirty feet long, was lined on both sides with plastic tubs
raised about a foot off the floor.  Inside the tubs were perhaps a
hundred potted canibis (marijuana) plants, each sporting a bushy top
of their distinctively branching five-part leaves.  Two rows of grow
lights hung down from the ceiling on chain links that could be
adjusted in length as the plants grew upward.  They ran off a timer,
which also periodically turned on a pump that flooded the tubs with
liquid fertilizer from a child's toy pool, that also caught the runoff
as the liquid percolated back down from the plants.  An air
conditioner hummed in the window, and a dehumidifier discharged into
the pool the water it condensed from the air.

Vic selected one of the mature buds, broke it off by its stem and
passed it to Mercuriou.  It was top-quality marijuana, never packaged
or pressed, covered with tiny white crystals of the psychoreactive
drug tetrahydrocannabinol.  The guest nodded his head in appreciation,
not really sure what to say, then finally mumbled some kind of
complement on his friend's carefully maintained operation.  Vic
selected another, similar bud, popped it in his mouth, and motioned
for his guest to do the same.

"I told you," the doctor wryly noted, "You should quit smoking...
It's bad for your health!"

Mercuriou grinned.

"So you eat it, like brownies?"

"Sure.  But why fool around with brownies?  It's better fresh, just
the way the Great Spirit made it.  I've got some AIDS and cancer
patients I take care of for free, and then there's the guys who pay
that keep this place running."

Another hour of small talk found them back out in front of the cars,
well intoxicated.

"I'll play their money game... I'll get out there and 'hustle', I'll
'compete', I'll rip and claw my way to the top, and when I get there,
I'll turn around and ram their global capitalist system right back
down their throats." [CA]

Vic bowed his head and struggled with conflicting emotions.

"How often do you pray, Marc?"

Mercuriou guffawed.

"Right now, my only prayer is that Burns can figure how to get this
thing into orbit... literally!"

"I'll need some time to think about this," Vic concluded after several
minutes.

Mercuriou nodded his assent and left.  Vic stood standing in the
shade, watching the driveway Mercuriou's car had disappeared down.
The dust had settled, and nothing disturbed the scene now except the
buzzing of insects. [what kinds of insects?]

Vic: "This will require a vision quest."


T - 355 days    religion must look like a waste of time

The entire eastern sky was lit a brilliant red hue, as if a pane of
clear red glass had been slipped in behind the mountains and lit from
below.  Eyes closed, wrapped in a light Indian blanket, Vic awaited
the dawn.  A bright yellow light pierced out from a gap in the
mountains and began to widen into the orb of the sun.  Though
conscious of the light, Vic put off opening his eyes.

One of his favorite prayer spots, the desert canyon looked like a
giant had slashed through the brown hills with a knife and the desert
had bleed a river.  Pristine granite boulders blanketed the slopes
fifty feet on either side of the water.  Cactus and scrub brush
covered the surrounding land.  Amid patches of sandy beach, swirling
pools and murmuring cascades were two-foot diameter logs wedged
between boulders twenty feet above the water line, mute witnesses to
the tropical cyclones that, two or three times a century, settled over
the canyon and filled the arroyo with the raging waters that had
carved it out over the ages.  The water was drinkable, and a gentle
breeze often discouraged insects.  There were flat rocks to lie out on
in the sun, and shady crevices to evade the heat during the peak of
the day, not to mention ample bathing spots in the cool river.

Vic had put this off for weeks, inventing one excuse after another why
he couldn't do it just yet.  He had to let his clients know he'd be
gone for several days.  He had to find someone to take care of the
cat.  There was something on TV he wanted to see.  The moon wasn't the
right phase.  He wanted to finish the book he was reading.  It was
already too late today.  It was still pretty early, he could putter
around for another hour or so before leaving.

The truth was, though Vic had decided to undertake a vision quest, and
knew intellectually that this was the course he wanted to follow,
neither was he looking forward to spending days in silence and
solitude.  He had done this before, and knew what he was getting into.

He opened his eyes, turned around and looked east.  The sun was the
distance of a man's fist over the horizon.  The doctor rearranged his
blanket so he could contemplate its orb, then spread his arms apart
and closed his eyes again, basking in the gentle warmth of a new born
day. _Another_day_among_days_. _Uncountable_as_our_breaths_of_air_

_Marc_Mercuriou_wants_to_fly_to_Mars_.  Vic turned the thought over in
his mind for the hundredth-odd time.  He drifted back over the years,
the college parties, the mathematical discussions and philosophical
debates, the night Burns drove home on three hits of acid, the
program, the lawsuit, the expulsion.  His head snapped back up.  Had
he been sleeping?  He wasn't sure.  The sun hadn't moved, or had it?
Perhaps it was infinitesimally higher in the sky.

_Marc_Mercuriou's_flying_to_Mars_.  Vic laughed out loud, softly.
What really were the chances?  Yet Burns was involved, so who could
say?  A pair to draw to, those two were.
And they say they've got some kind of super-hack, no, that he could
believe.  If Burns wrote it, they probably did control half
the Internet.

Burns had always led the mathematical discussions, and rarely cared
about the philosophical debates.

The sun crept higher and the desert began to heat.  Vic unfurled
himself from his blanket and spread it out as a ground cloth.  He
thought of all the stuff he could be _accomplishing_ right now.  He
needed to transplant those seedlings, and take more cuttings.  The
fence along the riverbed still needed to be repaired after the storm.
He could be making lasanga for lunch, ahhh, lasanga, he could go back
now and at least have it for dinner.  Drive into town for the noodles,
tomatoes from the garden, cheese, he had Ricota but needed Parmasean.

Vic physically shook himself.  _What_are_your_priorities_? Is it the
perfect baked lasanga or discerning the will of God, or the Great
Spirit, as Vic prefered to call him?
_Some_people_go_through_life_for_the_lasanga_.

Had the sun moved?  He wasn't sure.  _We_waste_so_much_time_, he
almost cried.  Of course, after a while, you know that you'd be
filling the hours with all the _distractions_ - television, food,
drugs, games, books, sex, talking, walking, driving, cleaning.  Out
here, alone, you realize that this is what you waste seven times a
week.

_And_then_we_throw_it_all_away_and_die_.

Vic stood up and stretched.  The strict Indian vision quest required
not only fasting and sleep deprivation, but was also done naked and
confined to an area no bigger than a patio.  Of course, the strict
Benedictine monk arose at three in the morning [CHECK] to pray, and
the strict Buddhist drank no water after sunset.  Vic fasted and
prayed, but was clothed and allowed himself a somewhat wider leash.
He climbed down to the water, hopping from boulder to boulder, then
striped naked and bathed.  The stream was still cool, and the morning
breeze imparted a definite chill that turned it downright cold, but in
this place, the rushing arroyo was a luxury Vic indulged.  He plunged
his head under a ten-foot waterfall and whooped out loud, then
stretched out and floated on his back in the pool at the waterfall's
base.  Emerging from the stream after a time, he laid naked on one of
the boulders, waiting for his skin to dry.

_If_you_go_, _you_might_never_come_back_, his own voice practically
spoke in his head.  _Well_, _no_, he answered,
_one_day_I_won't_come_back_.  One day he might be driving down the
highway, or walking to the store, and in the next moment meet the
Great Spirit.  Maybe he would pick the day and time himself, Lord knew
he had contemplated it enough.  Or perhaps he would go like some of
his patients, linguring, faltering, fighting death every step of the
way.  _Just_not_like_my_father_, please God, _not_like_my_father_, not
witless and lost in his own home, surrounded by the family he couldn't
tell from strangers.

_We're_all_going_to_die_. _It's_how_we_live_that_defines_us_.

The sun was now halfway to its zenith.  Slowly, Vic dressed, then
returned to his blanket.  Perhaps later he would indulge himself in
another bath.  Hunger was present, but by now, his third day, it
manifested itself more as fantasy than as any physical need.  Piña
colada.  That's what he wanted - a piña colada, made fresh from
coconuts and pineapples, pureed in a blender with only a flavoring of
rum.

_Mars!__He_can't_be_serious_.  Yet he was.  Vic had known Mercuriou
too long to suppose he was joking, too well to imagine he was insane.

Or not.  His encounter with Mercuriou had been shocking.  How
much he had changed!  They were like children
who had grown up in a nursery, with cartoon wallpaper and colorful
mobiles, and only occasional flickers of a distant fire glimpsed
through the window.  _Men_with_guns_on_a_cruise_ship_.
_An_angry_speech_in_a_foreign_tongue_.  _Soldiers_patrolling_a_street_.
_Protest_marchers_burning_a_flag_.

Then they emerged from the nursery to find the house engulfed in
flames, and no way out.  Many gave themselves to the fire,
toyed with the fire, learned to play with the fire;
many assumed that houses were meant to burn, that's why they were made
of wood.  Some had cowered in the basement, or taken refuge in the
game room.  Some tried to fight the fire.  Some jumped.

_Where'd_you_hide,_Vic_? _The_smoking_parlor_?

While his best friends became thieves.

Without moving, Vic looked to where an iguana had just scampered
across one of the boulders and darted into a crevace.  Life!  The
great mystery!  All around him, the plants, the animals, the birds
in the sky, the algae on
the rocks along the riverbed, all alive!  All part of some greater
consciousness!  What would an iguana know of Mars?  Yet both were
here, the iguana and the red planet, somewhere there in the sky.
_We_know_as_much_about_life_as_the_iguana_knows_about_Mars_.

Was it noon yet?  He wasn't sure.  He certainly hadn't brought
a watch.  No, the morning sun still falted the zenith.

_What_else_am_I_going_to_do_?
_Take_my_stolen_millions_and_retire_on_a_beach_?

It was hopeless to talk him out of it.  Maybe before, maybe when Vic
hadn't been there...

_What_else_am_I_going_to_do_?,
_live_in_a_trailer_and_grow_pot_in_the_mountains_?

Vic sighed.  His own life certainly hadn't turned out the way he had
expected it.

_I_wanted_to_be_a_doctor!_ The thought burst upon him with a flash of
anger that was gone as fast as it had come.

_Did_the_fish_want_to_live_in_water_?
_Did_the_cow_want_to_be_a_steak_?

Once in his life he
had been in a slaugherhouse.  Hundreds of cattle passing
through a shoot to be stunned and butchered.  An assembly-line
of death.  _We_don't_always_get_to_be_what_we_want._

What did he want?  Did it come down to that?  Maybe it wasn't about
the Great Spirit after all, maybe it was about Victor Antonov...

_Herasy!__Herasy!_ the voice shouted in his head. _We_don't_choice_for_ourselves;_we_must_DO_THE_WILL_OF_GOD!_

He awoke with a start.  The sun was visibly into the western sky.  How
long had he slept?  At first he felt rage at himself for sleeping,
then disappointment, then resignation.
_I'm_sorry,_father,_ he prayed, _I'm_not_a_kid_anymore._
He lay back down on the blanket and slept.

The sun was deep in the sky when he awoke.  He sat and watched it slip down
behind the mountains, until shade came to the arroyo, then watched the
light retreat up the slopes until only the summits were in direct sun.

_If_I_was_up_there_, _I_could_still_see_the_sun._

Finally the sunlight was gone, leaving
only a blue sky that deepened into purple, then black.  Crickets and
frogs trumpeted the arrival of night.  A rattlesnake slithered silently across
the still warm sand.  Here, away from the city lights, stars began to
emerge, first a dozen, then uncountable thousands.

_The_stars!_ Could there be life out there, too?  How could there not
be, in such vast reaches?  Was the Great Spirit only for this world?
Was there a different Great Spirit for every world, every sun?  And
the Greatest Spirit that transcended all?

_Who_knows?__This_is_dogma._

Dogma.  The bastard son of religion raped by logic.  The
psuedo-science of devising laws that govern a game we do not
understand.  For all the paucity of science, at least the physicists
demanded that their equations predict something real.

_Space._ Vic gazed up at the sky.  Blackness filled with light.
Thousands of ragging fires, tiny lights in their various
shapes and patterns, subtly hued and interspersed with dim
nebulas.  Orion loomed overhead.  Nor was the sky still.  Not only did
the stars shift through the night, but the lights of airplanes high
above passed slowly through the constellations and the occasional
unannounced meteor would flash past in a fraction of a second.  A
satellite transited overhead, still illuminated by
the sun.

_So_what_now?_ Vic didn't expect a booming voice from the heavens, or
a dramatic vision, though such things had been known to happen to others.  At
best, these quests ended in a quiet determination, a clarification of
purpose, a sense of a direction forward.  At worst, a torrent of
tears, disillusionment, and doubt that only time and prayer could
peer through.

_It's_how_we_live_that_defines_us_.  How was he going to live?
Growing pot in the mountains?  Twenty years in the big house with
Mercuriou?  Blown to bits in some goof-ball launch attempt?

_What_if_it_works?_ It was almost impossible.  How could something
this _crazy_ actually _work_?  _Crazy._ Yes, _crazy_.  Maybe he was
ready for something crazy!  He grinned, closed his eyes and tried to
empty his mind, tried to open himself to the Great Spirit.

_I'm_sick_of_being_sane!_ Vic practically lept to his feet at the
thought.  Why be sane?  Why not do something _crazy_?  What's the
worst that could happen - death?  No, jail would be a fate worse than
death.  Death he could handle.  Death meant meeting God.

Vic chuckled, this time aloud.  _Look_at_yourself_.  A trailer full
of marijuana plants and you're worried about _jail_?  Well, yes,
acutally, he was.  _Ahh,_to_hell_with_it._

If he went with Mercuriou, it might be a long, long time before he
returned to this place.  _Or_ever_.  He looked around - the rushing
water in the arroyo could now be heard but no longer seen.  Dim outlines of
rocks and scrub bush surrounded him.  This land was beautiful.  Did he
really want to part with it?  Locked in an airconditioned tube for who
knows how long? _Some_people_go_through_life_for_the_lasanga._

Orion had crept into the western sky.  To the south, a jet airplane
crossed to the east.  Vic cast his mind to it.  Most of the passengers
would be asleep, or trying to catch what sleep they could
in the jet-lag abbreviated night.  In a dimly lit cockpit, the
pilots guided the plane along a jetway, marked by radio
beacons and GPS coordinates, colorful radar displays
to show what was in front of them.  Would they peer down into
the darkness below?  To wonder if anyone was looking back up?

Once, long ago, a monk had prayed for guidance.  An angel appeared in
a vision to say that God's will was to serve men and in serving them,
to reconcile them to him.  Serve men?  The monk was incredulous.
Three times the angle repeated the command, then disappeared.

He was a trial judge.  The murder defendant had been convicted by the
jury, but Vic wasn't convinced.  He wrestled with his conscience.
Dare he overturn the verdict?  Dare he let an innocent man die?  In
the courtroom, spectators laughed, ate, talked on their cell phones.
Angry, Vic called for order, pounded on his gavel.  Didn't they
understand that the issue was life or death?  He struggled to deliver
the verdict, started, stammered, started again, and then the
prosecutor spoke.  There was new evidence.  The defendant was
innocent.  The charges were dropped.

Vic awoke.  Was there light?  Yes, the eastern sky was beginning to
brighten and he could just make out the ridge line of the mountains.
What did the dream mean?  That he was off the hook?  That he had made
the right decision?.  Do they mean anything?  He lay on the cool
earth, wrapped in his blanket, watching the stars fade out above.
_Sometimes_the_searching_can_get_in_the_way_of_the_finding._

Another day had past, another had come.  He would not fear death; he
would not fear jail.  Nor would he keep living in a house trailer,
puttering back and forth to his hydroponic garden.  He stood up and
stretched, then sat still until it was light enough to see, though not
yet dawn.  Slowly he rolled his blanket, then started down the trail
as the sun peaked over a ridgeline.  Halfway to the car, he looked
back toward the arroyo, regretting that he hadn't returned to bathe.


T - 239 days    youth must be corrupted

In 1998, John Pople became the first man in history to win a Nobel
Prize for writing a computer program.  It was called _Gaussian_, and
it numerically simulated Schroedinger's equation, the crucial formula
for explaining the complex interactions that formed atoms and
molecules.  _Gaussian_, and programs like it, made it possible to
analyze atomic structures in much the same way as numerical
simulations of Newton's equations made possible the analysis of
planetary movement in solar systems.  For hundreds of years,
scientists had sought the master formulae of a purely mathematical
Theory Of Everything.  Like two teams drilling a tunnel from opposite
directions, physicists and chemists had pursued a crucial thread of
this common quest, the physicists digging deep into the mysteries of
the atom while the chemists measured and categorized the myriad array
of substances.  Then, in the early decades of the twentieth century,
the physicists broke through the tunnel.  Quantum mechanics, the most
spectacularly successful physics theory of all time, came with one
slight/minor caveat - nobody knew how to solve its equations.

Stereo cranked, the windows reverberated with the beat
as the guitar lick arched to its climax.

_But_that_don't_help_you_in_the_...

Alister: "Bed-roooom!"  Alister bobbed his head and sang the refrain
out loud.

The office was actually the living room of a large plantation house
where [THEY LIVE IN OUTRIGGERS] Burns lived with a team of a
half-dozen young programmers.  The house's tile floors and stucco
walls overlooked a sandstone cliff dropping to an expansive beach and
the Pacific Ocean.  Waves crashed against a nearby point, surfboards
were stacked lazily [IMPROVE] near the beach trail, and broad overhead
fans circulated the sea breeze.  In a pair of curtain-side semis
hummed a parallel-processing system of more than a thousand
processors.

They were looking for a new type of rocket fuel, liquid at room
temperature and with better performance than the solids.  The bosses
were out of town and the other guys had taken off, so Alister had the
place to himself.  Twenty years old, with matted blond hair, he had
left South Africa to study abroad, finished a double major in
chemistry and physics, then stayed after graduating.  TenTech was his
first job [after college].

Yet Alister fancied himself a hacker, and had trained himself to read
keystrokes over people's shoulders.  Burns had carelessly allowed the
young chemist to watch him login to 'genie', and now Alister used that
password to enter the system and look around.  Its accounting records
showed one program used more than any other, so he ran it.

A new window appeared on his screen.  On it, brightly colored graphics
portrayed a cue stick deflecting billard balls into a neat square.
Each ball contained a number - sixteen, then thirty-five, then four.
Alister recognized it immediately.  It was a Keno game of the
type you might find in a casino.
_What's_all_this_secrecy_about_a_game_, the young man wondered.  Then
the bottom of the screen caught his eye, where the machine displayed
the current date and time.  _Bloody_hell!?!_


T - 237 days    politicians must lie and steal

Mercuriou: "What did he see?"

Mercuriou asked the question without emotion.  Behind him, the ocean
frothed and seethed gray-green under a steady rain, reflecting the
chaotic smear of light patterns that radar engineers dubbed "sea
scatter", then morphed into an indistinct horizon where rain met cloud
met ocean.

Burns: "He ran the program."

Mercuriou: "Did he understand what he saw?"

Burns: "Probably.  He's pretty sharp."

Mercuriou: "So he knows we're stealing something; but he doesn't know what,"

Mercuriou folded his hands in front on him on the desk.  He sniffed,
then chuckled, then finally broke out in a loud guffaw.

Vic: "You think this is funny?"

Mercuriou: "I think it's hilarious!  Our whole operation is made
possible by Burns' super-hack, and now along comes this
twenty-year-old kid who hacks _your_ system!  Now, how's the project
going?"

Burns: "The older engines work with the new fuel.  We've got a synthesis
pathway, but it can be improved.  We still need an airplane,
spacesuits, launch towers, tanks and just about everything that goes
in them.  And, of course, we don't have enough fuel."

Mercuriou: "And we need another big hack.  Or two."

Burns: "I'm swamped."

Mercuriou: "But we've found a hacker!"

Burns screwed his eyebrows and thought for a moment.

Burns: "He's sharp, real sharp.  One of the best we've got, and it
looks like he can hack, too.  I guess the real question is, will he?
For us?"

Mercuriou raised a finger in the air, an adrenaline rush surging
within him, like he was about to ask a stranger out on a date.

Mercuriou: "Let me take care of that.  Go get Alister."

RHETORIC IS A PERFORMANCE ART.

As soon as Burns was out the door, Mercuriou lept to his feet, erasing
the whiteboard then rearranging the chairs.  By the time Burns
returned with Alister, Mercuriou was back in his own chair, had swung
it around, and was leaning back against the desk, watching the rain
pelt against the suite's plate glass windows.  Vic directed Alister to
sit, and Burns closed the door.  The pelting rain and the breaking
surf were the only sounds as Mercuriou watched the streaks of water
sliding down the glass and gazed on toward the reef break as his mind
flashed back to college, back to one of his most energetic professors,
scrawling "RHETORIC" across the blackbord in foot-high block letters.

Mercuriou: "There was an unauthorized connection to 'genie' from your
workstation Saturday night at 9:43 PM.  It was encrypted of course,
but it lasted about an hour, and, of course, there are accounting
records."

Alister's face flushed red.  There seemed little point in denying the
obvious, but it was curiosity that had driven Alister; he wasn't a
natural thief or liar.

Alister: "I saw Burns type that password."

Burns: "You've seen me type the password?"

Alister: "I read it over your shoulder."

Mecuriou almost snickered again, then covered his mouth with his hand,
recovered, and pressed on.

Mercuriou: "And what did you see?"

Alister shrugged.  An awkward silence followed, then he answered.

Alister: "It's like tomorrow's lottery numbers today."

Mercuriou now got up out of his chair and walked to the window.  A
deep calm overcame him.  He felt like an ace closer walking to the
mound in the bottom of the ninth, dug in on the rubber, and turned to
pitch.  [COULD BE MORE POETIC]

Mercuriou: "OK, you figured that out, but it's a lot bigger than the
California lottery, let me assure you.  This is a _heist_."

"PAUSE FOR EFFECT," said the blackboard.

"You're robbing a bank?"

"We've already cleaned out one, and we're thinking about taking down
another.  We've got to get away, though; we've stolen too much
already.  That's why we need a new rocket fuel."

Mercuriou sat back down.  PAUSE FOR UNDERSTANDING.

"So, you're going... into space?"

"Mars."

Alister looked around.  He had entered the room expecting to be fired.

"Yeah, right, and I'm Mother Theresa."

"This is no joke."

"What I saw on that computer was no space shuttle."

BE READY TO SELL.

Mercuriou: "There will be!  Not exactly like NASA's; we've got a
different design.  But I'm no petty thief!  We've stolen because we
_need_ the money, need it to do something that'll make a difference
for the whole world.  We've got push space technology forward!"

Mercuriou: "Is the future here on Earth, Alister?  What do our leaders
want?  To drive technology forward?  Really?  Promote innovation?
Promote freedom? Is that why they've outlawed on-line libraries?  Is
that why they want a wall across our southern border?  Liberty?  Is
that what they call the drug war?"

Mercuriou stood up again and began to pace in front of the window.

Mercuriou: "They want to sell you gasoline, or video games, or stadium
tickets at prices people will grumble about and then pay while they
eat out every night and take their vacations on Maui.  We could have
video-on-demand, right now, I'm telling you!  We could take every
T.V. show aired in the last week and have it right there at the push
of a button!  We could take every book in the Library of Congress and
put it online for anyone in the world; we've _got_ that technology!
The only innovation our leaders want is innovation that they can
control!"

Mercuriou: "So we need a revolution, and it's not going to happen in
this world; the establishment is too strong.  But out there..."

Mercuriou: "Think about it, Alister!  Grow your own food!  Make your
own power!  The asteroids are practically pre-mined!  If we find
something like a pure vein of gold or paladium, everyone will be
copying this design to build their own spaceships and race after us.
If not, we can still mine the minerals we need to build more ships.
Silicon chip production should actually be easier in a vacuum!"

Mercuriou: "Six billion people on this people!  How many of them make
a difference, really?  How many of them change the world?  If the
human race is going into space, it won't happen seven colonels at a
time in a space shuttle, that's for sure.  We've got jump start it and
show that ordinary people can do it, not just a bunch of prima donas.
And _to_hell_ with what our great leaders here on Earth think about
it!"

Mercuriou let his voice trail off, walked to the window, and folded
his hands behind his back.

[FINISH THIS]

MAKE IT SEEM LIKELY!

"OK," he concluded in a low voice, "so it all sounds too wild to be
true.  Fine."

He turned and looked Alister straight in the eye [CA].

"Look at our launch facility.  Then tell me I'm full of shit."



Mercuriou walked up, his facial features hidden behind a pair of dark
sunglasses, just as Alister was asking Burns about the workers.  The
captain answered the question himself.

"Compartmentalization, Alister, need to know.  The surfers don't ask
too many questions.  But there's some stuff we need done that can't be
compartmentalized.  So if you're in, you get a spacesuit and a ticket
to Mars."

Alister looked back and forth between them.  It all seemed like a
dream.

"So what's my job?"


T - 112 days    the rich must persecute the poor

"So what'd you think?"

The car zoomed down Interstate 45 toward the Johnson Spaceflight
Center.  The morning rush hour had passed, and an electronic sign over
the roadway advised, "NASA Road 1 - 5 minutes".

"When I heard the learn'd astronomer..."

"Oh, come on, Andrea!  They're publishing the whole sythesis pathway!
And disclaiming all the patent right!  I thought you'd love it!"

She thought over yesterday's press conference.  Some new rocket fuel,
no _revolutionary_ new rocket fuel, truly revolutionary.  What were
they calling the company?  TenTech?

"Kyle, I just get sick of all these guys who act real cool, and wear
blue jeans to work, and call everybody 'dude', and deep down inside
they're a bunch of bastards.  Just you wait - I'll bet you they've got
some kind of angle on this.  The engineer seemed to really know his
stuff, but the CEO was a con artist."

"Well, 1033's no con, Andrea!  TenTech's ramping up to full
production!  Terry and Steve are working on a new design; they're
talking single stage to lunar orbit!  Maybe a shuttle without SRBs!  I
thought you'd be excited about this, I mean, this could really mean
people living in space!"

"Kyle, we've got airplanes flying between all of our major cities
every day, and for most of the six billion people on this planet, they
might as well _be_ space shuttles.  Our problems are here on Earth."

"Well, I thought you'd be excited about this."

"I didn't mean it like that.  I mean, if you want to do it...  I just
know that _my_ problems are here on Earth.  That's what I meant.  I'm
not going back into space again."

"OK, well... OK."

"Thanks for inviting me down, though; it's been too long since we've
seen each other."

"Well next time take a plane, I'll pay for it; you give me such a
fright hitchhiking!"

"You put your faith in God, Kyle.  And you tie your hair up under a
cap and and lose the miniskirt!"

"A space suit, yes; a mini-skirt, never!"

They laughed as Kyle pulled off the Interstate and stopped at a city
bus stop.  Andrea got out and pulled her bag out of the trunk.

"Sweatheart, you sure you don't want a plane?"  She shook her head as
his he pulled out five twenty-dollar bills and handed them to her.
"Just humor me this once and at least take the Greyhound!"

"Thanks, Kyle," Andrea said, giving him a hug.  "I love you."

Kyle nodded and got back in the car before quietly answering, "I love
you too, girl," and then cried out "Call me when you get home!" as he
drove away.

It was ten o'clock in the morning.  Andrea climbed on a half empty
downtown local and gazed out the window as the controlled access
highway gave way to mid-market chain restaurants, landscaped malls,
downtown streets and finally the transfer station.
_What's_wrong_with_me_, she wondered.  Wasn't Kyle right?  Wasn't it
good of these men to disclaim the patent rights on their invention
instead of trying to monopolize it?  _Give_to_all_who_beg_of_you._
Wasn't it the Christian thing to do?  _Maybe_I'm_just_being_cynical_.

At the transfer station, instead of walking the three blocks to the
Greyhound station, she spent five minutes decyphering a wall of posted
bus schedules, then climbed on another local headed into one of the
older sections of town, exiting [IMPROVE VERB] at a hundred-year-old
Catholic church that occupied almost an entire city block.  Built of
stone, glass, and metal bars, it could have been mistaken for a prison
except for the broad entrance stairs and the cross mounted on its
steeple.  Walking around back, she found a rear entrance, bearing a
colorful sign that read, "The Franciscan Fryer".

Entering, she found herself in a white tiled dining room populated by
collapable white tables and cushioned metal chairs which two men were
preparing for lunch.  Hanging against the far wall was a rood icon
cross, painted in Byzantine style, with a red background and a bevy of
saints behind the figure of the crucified Messiah.  Andrea recognized
it immediately - the San Damiano Cross, replica of the crucifix which,
eight hundred years earlier, had spoken in a vision to the young man
who knelt before it in prayer.

"Now go hence, Francis, and build up my house, for it is nearly
falling down!"

Francis of Assisi had looked around at the crumbling chapel he knelt
in and set out immediately to do as the vision commanded.  He [HAD]
returned to his father's cloth shop, took several rolls of fine cloth
(without permission), rode to a nearby market town, sold both cloth
and horse, and returned to the chapel, where he tried to press the
money into the hands of a reluctant priest.  Andrea had always felt
that it was a typical message from God: simple, powerful, and very
easy to misunderstand.

"We don't start serving until eleven," said the black man unfolding
chairs.

"I'm looking for Brother Dunstan."

"Oh, well, he's probably in the kitchen, then."

She walked to the rear of the room, seperated from the kitchen by a
long serving counter.  A pot-bellied man in his late forties, with
balding hair and a worn apron covering the brown habit of the
Franciscan order, muttered to himself as he stirred a steaming kettle
on the commercial stove that dominated the rear of the kitchen. [FIX]

"Andrea!"

"Hello, Dunstan!"

"Oh, Andrea!  What a joy it is to see you!"

"Thanks, hey this place looks great!"

"Well, you know, I had somewhat different expectations for it.  I'd
wanted something more like a restaurant, you know, that would also
serve as a soup kitchen if people couldn't pay, but Andrea, we just
couldn't pay the rent downtown!"

"That was the place on Travis Street?"

"Right!  I mean, a lot of people did pay, but usually only just enough
for their own food, you know, and then with those who didn't pay or
couldn't pay, well, we just couldn't afford to stay there.  It was a
nice location, but we just had to leave.  I prayed a lot, well I
worried a lot, and then this place turned up!  The rector here said we
could use the church's kitchen for free, and Andrea, you know, it's
been a real blessing, because I try to keep the place open seven days
a week, you know, and on Sundays now so many people stay after church
for lunch that it's really helped the congregation, you know, their
social life, and I get regular donations now from them, and well, I
just don't know what I would have done without it!"

Andrea sat down as the workers finished setting up the room, and
Dunstan put the finishing touches on lunch, which they shared just as
the first customers, mostly homeless, came in.  The food, especially
considering its meager pretensions, was excellent.  There was fresh
baked bread, coffee and orange Tang ("the drink of astronauts!",
Dunstan toasted), a thick lentil soup with just enough tomatoes and
onions to give it depth, and tuna salad, replete with chopped Granny
Smith apples and stuffed into the fresh bread, one of Dunstan's
signature dishes.

"Can you stay until Sunday, I'm making stuffed peppers, you know, I
always like to do a nice lunch for the congregation?"

"No, thanks, I'm heading back to my mom's place in Iowa today.  I just
came down to visit Kyle Becker, he has a new project, some people have
developed a new rocket fuel."

"You know, I heard about that!  They say it's quite revolutionary, is
that true?"

"Yes, it seems to be.  I know Kyle's quite excited about it."

"Well maybe we'll have one of our oblates flying back into space,
ehh?"

Andrea shook her head vigorously.

"No way, not a chance, I've made my last shuttle landing."

As she was leaving, she quietly took one of the envelopes from the
holders on each table.  It was blank, except for a quote from the
Gospel of Matthew: 
Bible: "When I was hungry, you fed me."

She fished the transfer slip out of her pocket and inspected it
closely.  It was still valid.  She put the rest of her money into the
envelope, sealed it, and slipped it into the drop box on her way out
the door.  Using the transfer to take a city bus to the northern
extremities of Houston, she walked another quarter mile to the
Interstate, sat down her duffle bag beside the ramp, and began
thumbing for a ride.

[INSERT HER HITCH HIKING EXPERIENCE]

More than a hundred cars passed in about an hour before a cab stopped.
Andrea had almost not bothered to raise her thumb when she had seen
the distinctive yellow car. _Judge_not_by_appearances..._

"I'm only going about twenty miles to pick up a fare."

"That's fine.  Thanks."

Those miles conveniently ended at an exit with a truck stop. She
didn't want to go into the restaurant, because she didn't want to
harass the truckers for a ride while they were eating, nor did she
want trouble with the management.  Instead, she fashioned a cardboard
sign reading "Iowa" and sat down with it between the parking area and
the on-ramp, making sure she could be seen from both.  Trucking
companies didn't like truckers giving out rides, but one of drivers
gave her a lift anyway.  He was going right through Iowa.

They talked through the afternoon as the miles fell away.  He was an
aspiring writer who wanted to hear everything she could tell me about
NASA.  He had also been busted for computer crime, was wearing a
monitoring bracelet on his ankle, and had now returned to his former
profession.  As dinner time approached, Andrea explained a bit more
about her religious order.

"I appreciate the ride, and don't expect you to feed me just because I
gave all my money away.  I can fast.  Seriously."

"But you get everything by begging, right?"

Darryl bought dinner at a diner in Oklahoma, [IMPROVE] during which
Andrea showed him a small plywood replica she kept of the San Daimano
cross and told him the story of St. Francis.

"So why did he give everything away?"

"He was inspired by a Gospel quotation during mass: Do not possess
gold, nor silver, nor money in your purses.  This was two years after
the vision."

"How on earth did he live?"

"Well, when he was rebuilding the church, he actually sang in the
marketplace and then asked his audience to donate stones.  The old
priest there would feed him dinner every night, but Francis didn't
want to impose on him, so he started taking a bowl and begging
door-to-door at dinner time.  By the time he ended his circuit through
Assisi, his bowl would be full, and that would be his dinner."

"So you should go around the dining room with a bowl!?"

"Yes, I'm not as good a Francisan as Francis.  Nobody is.  What's
happened to me is that I've found good friends and family to be my
surest supporters.  I don't travel as much as I should.  Maybe I'm
becoming a Benedictine."

They drove into the night.  Darryl began squawking into his C.B.
radio as they approached the Nebraska line.

"Got a rider here looking for a ride to Iowa Springs...  Any drivers
out there heading towards Iowa Springs?..."

After nearly an hour of intermittent radio calls, driving closer to
Iowa all the time, he finally raised a truck delivering a load only
twenty miles from her mom's farm.  She was able to help him navigate
the back roads leading there, called her mom to come meet her, and was
home in bed by three o'clock in the morning.



T - 100 days    the government must seem oppressive

[ON THE BEACH, WATCHING THE MOON SET]

Mercuriou: "Did you see this?"

NEW YORK (AP) - Keystone Securities (NYSE: KEY) declared bankruptcy
today in the wake of a computer malfunction that triggered an
automated series of losing trades.

Keystone, a leading global investment, securities trading, and banking
firm, relied heavily on automated trading programs to manage a
multi-billion dollar portfolio that was then sold off at fire sale
prices by the same computer programs.

According to published company reports, Keystone's market
capitalization was over $50 billion.  The trades triggered losses that
exceeded the firm's available trading capital by nearly $20 billion.
Auditors declared the firm insolvent over the weekend.

"What's surprising isn't that there was a bug in some trading
program," says Abruce Scowl [Oscar Cluweb], a consultant with Bull,
Bull and Bear, "but rather that there weren't sufficient controls and
safeguards in place to prevent a disastrous loss."

Both the SEC and the FDIC, which insures Keystone, have launched
investigations into the incident.

Although no criminal charges have been filed, legal experts have
speculated that Keystone could become a test case for corporate
liability in the face of a major computer malfunction.

...

Burns: "This could be serious."

Mercuriou: "Oh, it _is_ serious.  There's a countdown clock running on
this launch, just like with NASA's, T minus whatever-the-hell, only we
don't know what time it is.  We might have five minutes warning when
the cops come through that gate.  When that clock goes to zero, we
better be ready to launch."  [IMPROVE]


T - 93 days   it must be sly

Mercuriou: Any suggestions?

Burns: _Technical_Sketch_17_?

Mercuriou put his hands on his hips and stared at him.

Burns: Well, that's how I think of it...

They stood at the base of a 767, its engines replaced with rockets,
its doors welded shut, a hydraulic mating adapter on its nose.  It sat
in a hanger adjacent to their private runway.

Alister: _The_Royal_Way_?

Vic: But this isn't the Royal Way, Marc, it's all stolen!

Mercuriou's stare was cold, but there was a strange smile behind it.

Alister: _Baccala's_Manifesto_?

Mercuriou rolled his eyes... They _all_ looked at Alister like he had
just ruined the punchline to a great joke.  Then they looked at the
ship and...

Vic: "How about
_On_The_Evil_of_Capitalism_and_The_Danger_of_Democracy_?"

Mercuriou now shook - "You want me to put _that_... _there_!"  - and
waved toward the ship's cockpit.  Vic studied the spot thoughtfully.

Vic: "Perhaps something shorter would be better."

Burns: "The Great Anti-American..."

Alister: _Icarus'_Wing_!

Mercuriou:      What?

          "You heard me."

Mercuriou stared at the Afrikaner in disbelief.

"You know who Icarus was?"

     "Yeah."

"Like hell we're naming it _Icarus'_Wing_!  We're naming it _Xplorer_One_!"


T - 7 days    friendship must be repaid

"I'm inclined to say the thing looks like a front operation, but that
doesn't make any sense, either."

Sitting in the shade of her mother's porch, with a pitcher of iced
limeade on the table and two glasses half consumed, Andrea continued
to read the sheaf of papers in silence.

"You were right about Mercuriou, too.  I don't believe a word that
comes out of the man's mouth now.  I just can't figure out his angle."

"There's no question that this stuff works."

"None.  We've tested ten-thirty-three extensively; it's everything
it's cracked up to be.  That's what doesn't make sense!  They're
always having production problems; they need more time."

"No way.  Not with the quantities of nitric acid they're consuming.
They've already been shipped enough to fuel about three conventional
shuttle launches."

[ Kyle nodded.  He knew this as well, but only because he had first
[ calculated the quantity of nitric acid required to produce a kilogram
[ of nitroglycerine, looked up the energy released by a kilogram of
[ nitroglycerine and compared that to the energy consumed by a shuttle
[ launch.

"And why are they doing all this in Hawaii... why?"

Andrea pushed the papers away.

"Sounds like you need a detective, Kyle."

"I need somebody who can't get blown off by a bunch of techno-babble!"

Andrea laughed anxiously.

"What are you getting me roped into?"

He looked deflated.  Andrea sighed deeply.
[ _Give_to_all_those_who_beg_of_you_...  especially your best friend!

"All right," she visibly collapsed. "I'll go."

"Great!  Listen, I've got everything set up; their main facility is at
a place called South Point..."


T - 1 day    hitchhikers must be crazed and dangerous

[Hilo?  Kona.]

A few thousand feet over the Pacific Ocean, the inter-island jet swept
down Hawaii's leeward coast under the towering gaze of Mauna Kea,
grazed Keahole Point at a hundred feet and touched down at Kona
International Airport.  As the plane taxied and rolled to a halt at
the gate, the passenger in seat 15A stared at an ATM card.

_What_am_I_supposed_to_do_with_this_thing?_
"Just stick it in the machine and don't worry
about it." (Kyle) _...in_no_manner_are_they_to_receive_coins_or_money_

She threw it in the trash almost as soon as she got off the plane.
_It_has_to_be_done_The_Royal_Way_.

She traveled lite, foregoing a suitcase in favor of a backpack.

Exiting the terminal, a city bus stood in front of her...

"Excuse me, can you tell me how to get to South Point?"

"Used to be an airstrip down there after the war, but it's been gone
for years.  I don't think there's anything down there!"



Andrea looked down the lonely road leading off to the south.


Is this the address?  Down there?


_This_is_stupid._  I can't function in this society.

What do I tell Kyle?  How much money have I lost?  Just the airfare.
If I go back now, he can turn the card off, not too much damage done.
He might have to come out to Hawaii to get me, maybe he can hold my
hand through this...

_You_need_him_to_hold_your_hand?_


_How_long_is_this_road?__How_many_miles?_
_They'll_be_closed_by_the_time_I_get_there._


As the tears rolled down her face, she turned her face skyward and
implored God, "Why have you done this me?"  No answer came back from
the heavens, only the midmorning sun blazing down from a cloudless
sky.  The silence encouraged her to speak loadly and openly to the
diety, something she rarely did in the crowded city.  "Wasn't I
supposed to be blessed?  Weren't you going to take care of us like the
birds in the field?"

Emotionally exhausted, she fell down on her knees in the middle of the
roadway and cried steadily for several minutes.  It slowly dawned on
her that the situation could be a lot worse.  Sitting cross-legged,
she drank the rest of her water and took stock of her situation.

Her jeans and shirt were ripped from where they had snagged on the
barbed wire, her right side was covered in dirt from when she had
fallen, her hair was matted with dried sweat, and she had slept in her
clothes.

_This_is_stupid_, she thought.  _I_am_NOT_OK_.
_I'm_filthy_and_exhausted_, _and_I_can't_show_up_looking_like_this_.
_No_dumb_fuel_problem_is_worth_this_.

Andrea plopped down in the middle of the road.  She was so tired.  If
she could just sleep...

She was awake before the car stopped.

Two men were seated in the car, both dressed for the desert summer in
shorts, T-shirts, and sunglasses.  The man in the passenger seat was
talking on a cellphone and completely ignored her.  The driver, a
friendly fellow in his early twenties, asked her if she needed help,
and she mumbled something about her car being stolen and that she was
heading to the police station in town.  He offered her a ride, and she
climbed into the back seat as he started driving again.  The driver
spoke with a distinct foreign accent that she couldn't quite place.
Australian, perhaps?  He started talking to her, but the passenger
waved him quiet, as he was obviously having problems hearing the
phone conversation over the engine noise, and Andrea lapsed into
silence as they continued towards the Interstate.

"No, no, no, we've got plenty of 1033.  We've got tanks and tanks full
of it.  You can come see for yourself.  We just have to get the export
paperwork taken care of.  It's a delay, that's all," the passenger
told his listener, then fell silent for a moment.

Andrea now began to listen intently to the half of the conversation
she could hear.

"Of course it works!  You have the samples don't you?"

"Well, then make it yourself!  We can pay for the spacesuits in cash,
you know."

"Just let me handle it.  I know how my own government works."

"Cpacebo.  Cpacebo.  Dostvidanya."

The passenger clicked the cellphone off, then punched some more
buttons on it.  While Andrea slowly digested what she had heard, he
was making another call.

"Yeah, what's up?"

"Well, if he doesn't show, he doesn't show."

"A woman?"

Without disconnecting or even lowering the cell phone, he slowly
turned around in his seat, looking at her almost as if seeing her now
for the first time.

"I'm sorry, ummm, we weren't really introduced..."

"Andrea Yeats," she replied in a matter-of-fact tone.  "I'm with
NASA."

At various times, Andrea had seen people red-faced with excitement,
hysteria, and embarrassment, but now, for the first time in her life,
she actually watched someone's face as it turned red.  The flush began
just above Mercuriou's cheekbones, then, in a split second, spread to
his cheeks, his forehead, and then ran across his entire face.  He
clenched his teath and turned back around in his chair.

"I'll get back to you," he told Vic in a clipped voice, then severed
the connection without waiting for an answer, took the earpiece out of
his ear, wound its cord around the telephone and put in down on the
dashboard.  For a moment they drove on in silence.

"Turn around," Mercuriou quietly told Alister.

"Look, I'm heading into town, I can just walk back..."

"You're not going anywhere," Mercuriou interrupted her as he unclipped
his seatbelt and turned fully around in his chair.

Alister brought the car to a stop, then looked back and forth between
his two passengers with a pained expression on his face.  Meanwhile,
it slowly dawned on Andrea that, for the second time in two days, she
was being kidnapped.

"Turn around," Mercuriou repeated, "Go back."

Within sight of the Interstate, the South African executed a
three-point turn on the broad roadway and headed back the road along
which they had come.  Past the rocky crag, past where Andrea had
broken down while praying, across a desert mesa, past an automatic
gate that opened for them of its own accord, over a small bridge, up
to a warehouse where they parked, all the way in silence.

The dirt road had turned to asphalt as soon as they crossed the
bridge, and the parking lot was heavily scarred with the tire prints
of heavy vehicles, although the Toyota was one of only three cars
there at the moment.  Andrea followed the other two, partly out of
curiosity, partly because there was simply no place else to go.  This
time, she never thought of running.

They walked into a large room whose walls were lined with whiteboards
hung over cluttered office tables and whose center was a jumble of
cardboard boxes and packing material.  Burns was there, sporting a
baseball-and-marijuana-themed T-shirt captioned "I HIT better than I
PITCH", as was Vic, who looked up from a notepad as they came in.

"The man who called was named Kyle Becker.  Apparently this engineer,
Dr. Yeats, had a reservation at the Hampton Inns in town, but the
hotel says she never checked in, and..."

His voice drifted off as he glanced up at Andrea entering behind the
other two.  An awkward pause ensued.  Mercuriou turned around.

"Doctor Yeats," he began slowly, pausing and measuring his words,
"during the ride here... I was trying to decide... exactly..."

"What you're going to do with me?" she speculatively completed his
sentence.

"Precisely."

"What's going on?  What happened?" Vic asked, the second question
addressed to Alister as if expecting an explanation from him.

The young man opened his mouth as if to speak, but couldn't quite
explain how he had picked up a woman seated in the middle of the road,
or how Mercuriou had continued his imprudent cellphone conversation,
or how they had discovered the true identity of their passenger.
Finally, after a second or two, he just shrugged his shoulders and
closed his mouth without saying a word.

Andrea broke the silence.

"I believe the colloquial expression is that I 'know too much'."

"Um-hum," Mecuriou responded, nodding in agreement before turning
towards Burns.

"The old server room, can you rig the door so it can't be opened from
the inside without a card key?"

The engineer leaned back in his chair and nodded slowly.

"What are you thinking, Marc?" Vic asked with concern in his voice.
The only reply was a raised palm.

"Yeah," Burns began slowly, "the locking mechanism is in the wall, so
I could weld the door handle in place, along with the bolt.  You
couldn't open it at all from the inside..."

"Fine.  Let's do it."

"Now, wait a minute, Marc," Vic objected, "you're talking about
kidnapping now."

"Vic, we will have this discussion later."

"No we won't have it later..."

"Vic!"  The exchange was becoming heated.  "We will have this
discussion later!  We will have this discussion", he raced on,
gesticulating with his finger, "_when_Dr._Yeats_is_not_in_this_room_.
OK?  Now, _please_, let's just get all the loose stuff out of that
room while I stay here with the doctor."

The other three men looked slowly at one another.  None of them liked
what they were being asked, no, told to do, but Burns got up and lead
Alister down a hallway, leaving Andrea, Marc and Vic to eye each other
in silence, she sitting on a chair in the middle of the room, the
captain perched on a tabletop, and the doctor in a chair.  Twenty
minutes later, the South African returned to announce that the room
was ready.  Mercuriou escorted the NASA engineer down a hallway and
around a corner to a windowless twenty-by-forty-foot room populated
solely by a rectangular grid of floor-to-ceiling black steel frames.
Upon entering, Andrea turned back to face Mercuriou.

"Isn't this where I get some fancy explanation of what you're up to?"

"No," he answered, then closed the door behind him, insured that
it was locked, and began to walk away.

"Mr. Mercuriou," she called through the wall, "I'm sure we can discuss..."

The card key flashed through the lock with such a swoosh that Andrea
took an involuntary step back from the door, then another as it was
pushed open.

"Captain Mercuriou, it's _Captain_ Mercuriou!"

And he was gone.


Launch Day    it must be funny

"No, Marc, no, absolutely NO!"

"Three days, Vic, that's all we need - three days!  Burns wants
a week, but I'm compromising on three days!"

"You're not compromising on a damn thing, Marc!  You're talking about
holding someone prisoner - an innocent person - for days!  You've
already held her captive for a night!"

"It has to done, Vic!  It just has to be done, and we're not arguing
about it!  Alister!"

"Yes, we are arguing about it, Marc!"

"Alister!  Get an MRE and a bottle of water and give it to Dr. Yates!
Dammit, Vic, don't fight me on this!"

"Marc, you can't do this, you just can't!"

[TRANSITION]

Andrea had woke early in the darkened room.  She had no watch, and
there were no windows, but it had _felt_ like morning.  At least she
seemed rested.  She sat up against the wall and began to pray,
starting with the Lord's Prayer.  Softly, just barely audibly, she
repeated it three times, each more slowly than the last, contemplating
the words more deeply each time.

_Thy_will_be_done._ _Am_I_here_for_a_reason,_Lord?_  _For_your_reason?_

_...as_we_forgive_those_who_trespass_against_us..._
_I_forgive_these_people_here_, Lord, _they're_almost_comical_

_...deliver_us_from_evil..._
[ _deliver_us_from_HOWARD_

As she did so often, she returned to Christ's prayer in the garden,
"not my will, Father, but thine."  _Not_my_will,_Lord_,
_if_you_have_some_ _reason_for_me_to_be_here, _and_you_must_,
_thy_will_be_done_, Lord, _thy_will_, _not_mine_, _thine_.

She sat still, practicing a Buddhist exercise that she had learned at
a class and adopted for Christian use.  She focused on her breath, in
and out through her nostrils.  She tried to clear her mind of her own
thought and cast it upward, trying to enter a calm state where she
could, just maybe, like Elisha in the cave, hear the still, quiet
voice of God.  When she got caught up in her own imagination, she
re-focused on her breath and tried to calm her mind again.

She didn't do a very good job.  In fact, she never did a very good job.
Meditation was the hardest thing she had ever attempted, far
more difficult than executing some suited procedure that she
had practiced a hundred times in a water tank on the ground.
Her mind kept racing back to her present situation, all the
craziness of the last two days, _why_didn't_she_run_again?,
_what_do_they_want_with_spacesuits?_, then _breath_in_,
_breath_out, _breath_in_, _breath_out.

At least she resolved upon a plan, if you could call it that.  She
waited quietly until the electronic lock clicked and the door was
cautiously pushed open.  It was the blond-haired youth with the
foreign accent.

"Sorry," he began.  "I brought you some breakfast!" he added as
cheerily as he could muster, putting a bottle of water and a military
ration down on the floor next to the door.

"Do you think I could use the bathroom?" Andrea asked, standing up and
pushing her hair back.  He seemed indecisive, and didn't answer at
first.

"Look, I've covered in dirt; I haven't bathed in... three days; I've
slept in my clothes for the last two nights; I'd like to at least
splash some water on my face and go to the toilet."

There was no need to lie.  It was all true.

"OK... uh, sure, it's right down the hall," he answered, before
leading the way about a hundred feet to a restroom.

"I'll wait here," he mumbled.

She turned on the water facuet, and immediately started searching for
a way out.  The room had no windows but was covered with a ceiling of
drop panels.  Climbing onto the back of a toilet, she could reach the
ceiling and push one of the ceiling panels aside.  She started to
scramble up, but saw that the wall continued straight up to another
ceiling several feet above the panels.

"Damn," she muttered to herself, then climbed down and went to the
other side of the room.  The sinks might be strong enough to support
her weight.  Returning to the toilet, she realized that she could just
reach a large, circular pipe above the panel ceiling.  Climbing up
againd and grabbing it, she pulled herself up to it and found herself
crouched in a dark, dusty space between the two ceilings.  In the dim
light, she could make out the course of the wall down to where it met
the hallway.  In the other direction, the crawl space seemed to extend
beyond the bathroom, so she clambered along the pipe in that
direction.  Once past the bathroom, she opened one of the ceiling
panels below, swung her legs down into it, and dropped down into the
sunlit room below, slipping, grabbing the ceiling, and bringing part
of it crashing down with her.

There were chairs, a desk, books, a drafting table covered with
papers.  She picked up the telephone handset on the desk, then stopped
to look at the books on celestrial mechanics, materials science and
rocket propulsion.  She put down the phone and walked over to the
drafting table.  _Spain_never_designed_a_rocket_engine_.
_They_aren't_selling_fuel; _they're_hoarding_it.
_They_need_spacesuits,_too._

....

Mercuriou: "Vic, we are not arguing about this!  This is a command decision!"

Alister: "Um, excuse me..."

Vic: "Damn it, Marc, I'll go to police right now!  I'll pick up that phone
myself!  I mean it!"

Mercuriou: "Vic, if you pick up that phone, I'll... I'll..."

Alister: "Um..."

Mercuriou: "What!!!?"

Alister: "It's Dr. Yates, she's still in the bathroom..."

Mercuriou marched down the hallway.

Mercuriou: "Coming in, professor, pull up your pants!"

Broken from her reverie, Andrea snatched up the phone once more and
dialed Kyle, listening to the noises in the next room as it rang.

Andrea: "Kyle, it's Andrea!"

Kyle: "My God, girl, where are you?"

Andrea: "I'm at TenTech; they're holding me prisoner here!"

Kyle: "What?!"

Andrea: "Look, they've got a launch on!"

Kyle: "What's the payload?"

Andrea: "Manned.  They have spacesuits... and forget three shuttle launchs;
they've got enough fuel here for three hundred!"

The door's electronic lock clicked open and Mercuriou dashed in.
Andrea dropped the phone, threw the chair through a window and jumped
out.  Running up the road, she began to calm down as she reached the
runway.  _What_if_they_have_guns?_ _What_if_they_do?_
_Where_are_they?_

They were glued to a webcam of the highway junction, which showed
police squad cars peeling off to the south in response to the
kidnapping report.

Mercuriou: "OK, our launch clock is at zero...
Alister: but
Mercuriou: ...It doesn't mater!  Let's get to the ship!"

They dashed up the road to the hanger, where they found Yeats.

"This is quite a rocketship you've got here."

Mercuriou motioned his crew toward the access platform after they
had opened the hanger doors.

"You have some kind of launch planned?"

"You could say that."

Mercuriou climbed the metal staircase while Andrea followed him
silently.  _A_private_manned_launch_.  For the first time since she
had agreed to work again, she actually wanted to laugh.
_THIS_I_have_GOT_to_see_.

Mercuriou had reached the hatch, climbed inside, and turned around.
"Well, Doctor, you can go now.  Sorry for your detention, but it was
necessary at the time..."  he began, but never finished, because
Andrea grabbed the rim of the hatch, swung her feet up, and kicked him
squarely on his shoulders

"Captain Mercuriou!  _Captain_ Mercuriou!"  she hollered as she
clammered in behind him.

"What's going on?", Vic called from the cabin.

"It's Captain Mercuriou!  He fell!"

Mercuriou flew to his feet, so enraged that he half-hallucinated four
men with red shirts and black pants, already moving to seize the
intruder and awaiting only his order to throw her out.  He blinked and
they were gone.

"Do you want the hatch closed now?  Is that your next order... sir?"

[ All eyes turned to Mercuriou.

"You don't what you getting into, lady."

"Clue me in."

They locked eyes for a moment, then Mercuriou pressed his face within
six inches of hers and almost whispered, "Mars!"

She broke into a wide grin.

"That's great; I've always wanted to go to Mars!  Anyway, you'll need
an experienced astronaut; I've had three weeks on orbit."

He tried to interrupt, but she shushed him.

"But first, you've got to _get_ into orbit, and that I've _got_ to
see!"

Alister: "Here come the coppers!"

"Burns, start the engines!" [Mercuriou yelled, then turned back to
Andrea.]  "OK, this is it, this is it, I'm not kidnapping you - Vic
you are my witness! - I'm not forcing you, but you get out now, I'm
telling you we're not coming back for a long long time, I say get out
right now, or you're in this for good, and I mean FOR GOOD!"

It felt like the time she picked up Dunstan in the rain, like the time
she wrote 'math class' on the auction form, like the time she decided
to quit NASA.  It just felt _right_.  She nodded her head.

"Fine," he replied in a clipped voice, and told Burns to take off.

_Xplorer_1_ sped down the runway as policeman swarmed the complex.

[MAYBE] The rocket plane took the entire runway and then some...

Burns eased back on the control yoke, and the rocket plane soared
upwards into the sky.  Some of the policemen on the ground watched
with their months agape, deafened by the roaring rocket engines and
stunned by the sight of a jumbo jet belching rocket exhaust.  Burns
climed to 10,000 feet, then put the ship on auto-pilot.

Burns: "Launch cargo!"

Alister keyed a command sequence on his computer.  From underground
silos [camouflaged lauchers] on the mesa below, first one rocket
thundered aloft, then another, and another.

"Three all-green; four launching!" Alister was calling out as he read
from his computer monitor.  Behind them, Vic and Mercuriou argued over
the lack of a spacesuit for Andrea.

"She doesn't really need a spacesuit," Mercuriou tried.

"She most certainly does need a spacesuit, Marc.  We have spares in
cargo, but what if we lose cabin pressure before then?"

Mercuriou was silent for a moment.  Only Alister's voice was heard.

"Seventeen's up; sixteen just went inertial; eighteen launching!"

A panic seized the nearby towns as missile after missile streaked
skyward; many thought the nation had gone to war.

"We have to abort the mission," Vic flatly stated.

"We are not aborting this mission!" Mercuriou shouted.

"I'm fine," Andrea interjected, "I'll take the chance."

"No, you are not fine!  I'm the ship's doctor, and telling you, Marc,
we have to abort this mission because _she_could_get_killed_ if we
lose cabin pressure."

"Nine just acquired LEO; thirty-four launching."

"Then let her take mine," Mercuriou finally decided.

"No, she can't take yours, because then _you_ won't have a spacesuit."

"OK, so then I'll die and you'll be rid of me and you can do whatever
you want!  Look, Vic, we can't go back!  If we go back, we go to jail!
I'll take my chances with death!"

Vic relented.  Death over jail, that he understood.  Andrea got the
spacesuit.

"How do we look, Burns?"

"We've got clean launches on the first fifty-one rockets... make that
fifty-two; everything's going fine.  We're ready to take her up."

As soon as Andrea was suited, Burns put the plane into a near vertical
climb.  It wasn't the most optimal launch profile, but the aircraft
wasn't designed for supersonic flight, so Burns made sure he climbed
above the atmosphere before beginning a true orbital insertion.  As
they passed 100,000 feet, the conventional control surfaces become
unusable due to the rarified atmosphere.  Burns took his left hand off
the control yoke and placed it on a joystick.

"Release engine gimbles," he instructed.

"Engine gimbles released," Alister acknowledged, after pressing a
button and watching several indicators change color.

The rocket engines, in hydraulical mountings, now swiveled at Burns'
command.  As they passed 200,000 feet, he nudged forward on the
joystick, the engines pivoted downwards and the aircraft turned
towards the horizontal and increased thrust.  The sky was completely
black.  As the aircraft turned towards horizontal, the
giant blue ball of the Pacific Ocean swung up below them.

Burns switched his primary display from the almost useless airplane
indicators to an precomputed orbital injection profile based on
continually updated GPS coordinates.  The display showed the projected
course in blue, from both side and top perspectives, along with the
plane's actual course in red.  The aircraft was slightly below the
profile, so Burns eased back on the joystick to raise the plane's
attitude slightly and guided the red line back towards the blue one.
He didn't believe in autopilots, and hadn't taken the time to program
one for the spaceflight phase.

At fifty miles in altitude, they were now above most of the
atmosphere, and the blue line flattened out.  Burns guided the
rocketship along it.  Most of the engine force was now directed
towards increasing the craft's speed to orbital velocity.  Ten minutes
later, the 767 was eighty miles high and the GPS indicator showed
their speed at 10 km/s.  Burns continued firing the engines until
nearly two thirds of the ship's fuel had been exhausted.  He then cut
off the engines and let the ship coast.  Now well over two hundred
miles in altitude, the ship continued to climb.  Finally, Burns fired
the engines again for several minutes to stabilize the orbit.

The cargo modules, launched two minutes apart over the course of an
hour, were now spread out all over Low Earth Orbit, while the 767 with
the crew onboard was in a six-hour orbit hundreds of miles above.
This was deliberate.  Since the cargo modules were themselves hundreds
of miles apart, rendezvousing with each of them in LEO would have
required many complex engine burns.  Instead, considering that their
ultimate goal was Mars, Burns had elected to put the 767 into a higher
orbit, then wait for each cargo module to come into a favorable
alignment, fire its rocket engine remotely, and put it into a transfer
orbit that would bring it to them.  This enabled the crew to bring
each cargo module to them, roughly one per hour, over the course of
the next several days.

On Earth, confusion reigned.  CNN reported the last several launches
live, and speculation was rampant that the missiles contained some
kind of chemical or biological agent.  Around the world, TV networks
began interrupting their regular programming to cover the event,
showing graphical ground tracks of the orbiting cargo modules and
warning people as they drifted above.  The U.S. State Department was
fielding a barrage of queries from foreign embassies anxious to know
what was happening.  The President abandoned a trip to Europe and
turned Air Force One back towards Washington, D.C.  Somehow, amid all
the ballyho, the 767 had been lost completely and effectively
disappeared into high Earth orbit.

Two hours after _Xplorer_1's_ launch, Burns fired the rocket
engine of the first cargo module and put it into its transfer orbit.
NORAD detected the course change and reported it to the Pentagon
within minutes, who immediately passed this information on to an
emergency session of the National Security Council.  By the time the
third cargo module had been put into its transfer orbit, the Air Force
was convinced that the engine burns were lifting the modules into
higher orbits, not deorbiting them for some kind of attack.  They
computed the rendezvous point, aimed their imaging telescopes at it,
and were shocked to find themselves looking at a 767.

In Washington, the President held a hurried meeting of his national
security team, finally blowing up in frustration at their inability to
provide any concrete answers, throwing a briefing folder across the
room and sending top secret papers flying everywhere.

"What the hell do I have you guys for if I've got to find out from CNN
when 170 missiles get fired off in Wahi-wahi-...whatever-the-hell?"

That evening, the President addressed a rapt but unshaken nation,
informing them of basically what their news networks had been
reporting for hours.  A renegade group of entrepreneurs, under
investigation for wire fraud and kidnapping, had somehow managed to
execute the first private manned space launch.  Aside from reassuring
them that the U.S. government was carefully tracking the situation,
the only new information he provided was the identities of the three
principle officers of TenTech.  From his home in Houston, Kyle Becker
watched the press conference alone and in silence.

Andrea Yeats was never mentioned.


T + 1 day   long political rants must be interspersed throughout the novel

Andrea: "Excuse me?"

Mercuriou opened the door a crack.

"Yes?"

"What are you doing?"

Mercuriou had hollered since launch to get lined up with the cargo
modules.  They assembled them together by matching orbits, docking
their nose, then re-positioning them into a higher orbit, connecting
them together as they went.  They collected first Module A-1 Captain's
Quarters and then attached Module A-1-1 Captain's Storage.  Mercuriou
then halted the entire operation to dock with A-1, equalize pressure,
and disappear.

"I'm working on my speech for this evening, Dr. Yates.  It must be
delivered live in American prime time.  I wish I had longer to
prepare, but your stunt disrupted my timing.  Now please leave me
alone."

Andrea mumbled a reply into the closing door.

"You know, there's really a lot of work to be done with the cargo
modules..."

The door flew back open.

"Dr. Yeats, my speeches are the most important cargo this vessel
carries!"

[ He shushed her out the door and didn't appear again for another hour. ]

The news of the rocket launch had galvanized the world, or at least
everyone in the world, or at least everyone in the Most Important
Country In The World.  Now came live pictures of a man floating
in zero-gee, in a manner quite unprecedented.

He had prepared an elaborate set.  [HOW WOULD ASTRONAUTS LAY OUT AN
IDEAL WORK SPACE?  WOULD LIKE TO GET THIS RIGHT IN ONLY 1 DAY] He
could easily appear either strapped in to a chair by a belt, or
floating in mid cabin.  Red banners festooned the cockpit wall across
from the camera.  Two vertical Roman lances impaled with globes of
Mars rose on either side.  Mercuriou himself was dressed in a crisp
white uniform and floated leisurely behind a podium, at whose rear was
a computer screen visible only to the speaker.

"Good evening.  My name is Captain Marcelius Mercuriou.  Most people
call me Marc."

[MORE HERE]

"I am declaring tonight the Republic of Mars.  It shall be based on
the following principles.  First, freedom of speech.  There shall be
no prohibition of on-line public libraries.  Second, freedom of body.
The individual, not the government, shall decide what goes into that
individual's body."

"We have no weapons to launch against you, and we seek only to go on
our way in peace.  I have been told repeatedly by people to Love It or
Leave It, and I wish to tell them that I have decided to Get The Hell
Out."

Mercuriou had agreed to be interviewed after his speech, but had
rejected any one network and instead reserved the right to choose his
interviewer, selecting an obscure small network anchor.

"Captain," the anchor started on schedule.  "There have been serious
questions asked in the last 24 hours about your financial status.  May
I ask how you funded your space launch?"

"We stole it!" he replied, right on script.  "Every dollar of it, and
we needed billions."

"Are you saying you stole a billion dollars?"

Mercuriou laughed.

"We stole more money that Bernie Madolf every saw!"

"I don't understand; couldn't you have gotten venture capital funding?"

Mercuriou sneered.

"Venture capital funding - How do you get it?  I'll tell you how.  You
sell your soul to these people.  You convince them, and I mean really
convince them, that you're one of them, that you believe in their
nightmare philosophy of greed, you bring them on your management team,
you sign off on some 'business plan' that tells how you're going to
patent and control this technology once it's developed, because their
whole philosophy is to stand behind a counter and do nothing for
anyone unless they're getting something out of it for themselves, and
then you fight like hell just to keep 51%.  Or you toil away in your
garage for ten years of nights and weekends while working some stupid
job just to pay for the stupid garage, and I'm not much of garage guy.
So we developed, let's just say, an original source of financing."

"Did you rob a bank?"

Mercuriou starting laughing again.

"Something like that.  Ever hear of Keystone Securities?"

Everyone had heard of Keystone.  The news anchor paused for effect and
then continued.

"Why not just steal the money and retire on a beach in Aruba?"

"Well, that's a good question.  I guess, basically, I'm 31 years old
and not ready to lounge on a beach just yet.  Spaceflight has always
facinated me."

"Now in a capitalist society the only way to get anything done is to
have some kind of money-making scheme, some kind of 'business plan',
like I was saying, and we've got no business plan of any kind for how
you recoup this many billions of dollars.  So the only way to do it
was to either be rich, or steal it, or be the government and do both."

"It shows how little opportunity we really have to pursue our dreams.
Spaceflight _can_ be done, but we live in a society hell-bent on
forcing people to work for a System, and telling them constantly that
they have freedom."

"You don't think we have freedom?"

"Why don't you ask all those 'people'?  Ask them if they'd rather be
flying into space or doing whatever mindless job they've got now, and
see what they say?  And be sure to point out to them that our great
capitalist leaders could be mass producing spacecraft by the
thousands.  Ask yourselves, 'if they needed them for a war...'"

"And the investors in Keystone Securities?"

"People with money to burn, dumping cash into a high-risk mutual fund.
I'll bet not one of them would buy a bum a hamburger at McDonalds.
Let's apply their own rational.  I'm 'helping them compete'.  If some
of them go out of business, so what?  Businesses fail every day.  I'm
developing technology to fly to Mars, so the whole society benefits.
We rip and claw at each other throats, and that drives civilization
forward, right?"

"I think some people would say that we play according to the rules,
and you've broken those rules."

"Yeah, who makes the rules?"

"Well, the rules are made through a democratic process."

"In other words, the majority makes the rules, right?"

"That's right... the majority."

"Well, I'm not part of the majority."

He started to chew a piece of gum.

"I'm not part of the majority... I'm a druggie!  I'm a socialist!  I'm
an anarchist!  I'm the most anti-American American since Jane Fonda!
I'm not part of the majority, and I don't like democracy."

"But if it's what the people want..."

"'The People'.  You make it sound like it's what _all_ the people
want.  If that's the case, then why do people blow up federal
buildings, why do people bomb our embassies, why do people burn the
country's flag?  Obviously, there's a lot of people who don't agree
with these rules, and I'm one of them.  The majority makes up these
rules, and then expects everyone else to obey them just because
they're make 'through a democractic process'.  People obey the rules
because they're afraid of what will happen to them if don't.  The only
thing that's different about democracy is that it's a different group
of people making the rules.  In Russia it was the proletariat, in
Germany it was the Arian race, here it's the majority.  It's always
the same.  Some big bunch of millions and millions of people that
think that because they're more advanced, or because they're the
workers, or because there's more of them than anybody else, that they
have the right to rule everyone else's lives and build some big prison
system for those who won't do what they're told."

"The communist philosophy was based on brutal, cut-throat class
competition; the fascist philosophy was based on brutal, cut-throat
racial competition; the capitalist philosophy is based on brutal,
cut-throat economic competition.  It's basically the same thing,
slightly editted for a new generation, but with the same kind of
garbage in charge of society.  'Conflict and competition drive human
progress forward...'  I feel as bad about ripping off capitalists as I
would about ripping off communists or fascists, because to me they're
all basically the same.  Just another bunch of men with some nightmare
system based on the most viscious traits of mankind to be jammed down
everyone's throats."

"Yet there are alternatives!  Not many left on Earth, mind you.  Earth
is civilized, which means it's been conquered, colonized, and
commercialized.  No matter where you go, there's some established
government, be it democracy or dictatorship, and you're just a little
cog that better turn when its supposed to and not need too much oil.
Out here, though, is an entire solar system waiting to be tamed!"

[this is where he elaborates his plan, culminating in...  "We are
_Xplorer_1!"]

He looked at his watch.

"Listen, we've got a lot of work to do with the cargo modules.  I'll
contact you...  I'll let you know the next time I'll be in touch."

And he was gone.




than any of us and we needed any reminder of that, we got it
yesterday."

The captain paused briefly and looked over his crew.

"Andrea, if you're willing to take the job, I'd like to make you first
officer."

Vic spoke first.  "I think that's a very good idea."

Now it was Andrea's turn to look over the crew.  She spoke first to
the captain.

"There's a lot of things I think we're not going to agree on..."

"I can handle dissent.  In fact, I encourage it."

"...starting with your basic mission plan.  NASA has looked carefully
at a manned mission to Mars.  We'd prefer to send three separate
vehicles.  Unlike a moon shot, a free-return trajectory isn't an
option for a Mars mission.  It's just too far away to coast home after
an Apollo 13-type failure.  A single vehicle, no matter how well
equipped, lacks a level of redundancy that only multiple vehicles can
offer.  Also, any new vehicle needs to be extensively tested before
and after launch."

There was another pause.  The only sounds were motor noise from the
air conditioners and computers.

"We're not going do things the way NASA does them.  Dissent is
welcome, but I'm still the captain.  I get the final say."

Andrea looked him directly in the eye.

"OK.  I accept."  [NEED MORE HERE]

"Thank you."

"You actually did most of the right things yesterday.  Secure the air
tight doors and come after me with a spacesuit in case I get into
trouble.  Just one thing - next time, bring two suits, or at least a
rescue ball.  It would have sucked if we had got stuck out there with
only one suit between us."

"Look, there are certainly plenty of people who would love to quit
their jobs, throw off their leaders and fly away into space, but how
are they supposed to get up here?  The simple fact is that you had to
steal billions of dollars just to lauch five people into orbit, and
that's fairly consistent with NASA's cost budget.  What you're
suggesting is completely impractical."

"OK, I'll concede that they're not going to make it up here exactly
the way we did, but what's the alternative?  There's nothing left on
Earth.  It's a failed planet turning into one big global hegemony."

"You can't rationalize a decision just by saying that the alternatives
are unacceptable."

"Why not?"

"Because the solution to missing the school bus is not to invent a
time machine!  Sometimes _all_ of your options are unacceptable.  Then
it becomes very easy to pick the most attractive one and gloss over
its manifest defects.  That's why we have planning meetings and
project cost estimates.  That's why we use Gantt charts and Capability
Maturity Models.  It's not just bureaucratic bean counting. [CA] If
_none_ of your options are capable of hitting your target, then you
need to know that _before_ you push the little red button in the
launch tower!"

Mercuriou paused and studied her.

"Andrea, I have studied these options.  The one I've chosen certainly
has a lot of defects, but I really am convinced that it might work.
Mars, I admit, is a bit of a publicity stunt, but after we've landed
there I want to take a close look at the asteroid belt.  There are
probably more minable mineral resources there than on the entire
Earth.  With the automation we've got, if we can set up a
manufacturing plant there, we can build more ships like this one.
We've already built one, so we know how to do it.  We can set up
hydroponics to grow food, establish a colony there and send ships back
to Earth to bring more people."

"We're not going to need the hydroponics, Marc."

All eyes turned to the hatch.  Though the crew, gathered together in
A-core, had not specifically excluded Vic, they had grown used to his
absence.  His first appearance outside his quarters in a week now
stunned everyone.  While Mercuriou silently assimilated his statement,
Andrea was the first to respond.

"So how was the meditation, Vic?"

"Andrea, the meditation was... great.  I've always struggled to
achieve really deep meditation; my mind's always going a million
different places at once.  It's the hardest thing I've ever done, but
up here... floating... weightless... up here it was _easy_!  But I
suppose you already knew that!"

"Actually, I've never been much into meditation."

"Oh, come on.  Prayer, meditation, listening to God... call it what
you will.  Don't tell me you've never sat for an hour in silence in
some quiet chapel somewhere."

Slowly, Andrea nodded.

"Hae you never tried it up here?"

"I can... well, no, truthfully one of the most profound spiritual
experiences of my life came during a spacewalk.  But usually my time
on orbit is so stressed out and hectic, not to mention cramped and
noisy, that, no, I don't really see space as a time for prayer and
contemplation.  Maybe I should."

"What did you mean," Mercuriou now slowly asked, "that we don't need
the hydroponics?"

"I'm not sure, Marc.  It's just real clear to me now that you're not
going to need a doctor, and you're not going to need the hydroponics."

"So...what?  We're just going to give up after a year and go home?"

"Maybe.  I don't know."

"What then?  You're saying we're going to die up here?"

"No, I didn't say that, either.  I can't really explain it, Marc,
except to tell you that I wrestled mightily trying to decide whether
to come along with you on this.  I know now that it was totally worth
it, I'm thrilled to be here, I don't question it now for a minute, but
I also know that... I've gotten _centered_, Marc, I don't know how
else to explain it, I've gotten centered, and I understand now that my
presence here is totally superfluous.  You don't need me... as a
friend, yes, but not for anything else."

"And what happens," Mercuriou slowly asked, "when our food runs out?"

"I don't know."

"You've just got... a 'feeling'?"

"More like a certainty."

There was another long pause.

Alister: "Can I say something?"

"Sure, say whatever you want."

"Well, if we move out of orbit, I mean, that's what we're taking
about, right?  That puts us out of range of the space shuttle!?"

"That's a real good point, Alister," Andrea said gravely, then spoke
directly to Mercuriou.  "Look, you've made your point.  Now we've got
to test this craft.  Let's start looking at re-entry scenarios..."
but the Captain was ephastically shaking his head, no, No, NO!

"We're going to Mars, Dr. Yeats, that's not going to change."

"Fine, you can go to Mars," Merceriou started to interrupt but-Yeats-
would-not-let-him, "but first you've got to test this spacecraft in a
controlled environment where there are rescue options both in orbit
and on the ground."

Again there was silence, but a deeper, tenser one.

"She's got a good point, Marc," Burns concluded.

Merceriou guffawled.

"First Vic, now you going turn traitor on me too, Burns?" he asked
with a snicker in his voice.

Burns answered with a laugh in his.

"Hey, I'm just saying what she says makes a lot of sense!"

"Burns, the minute, nay, the second these wheels touch the ground,
we're just five little nobodies at the mercy of those governments."

"We could contact a neutral country," Andrea continued to argue,
knowing she had lost.  "Switzerland might let us land."

"Sorry, Doc," Mercuriou said.  To Burns he added, "Take us out of
orbit."

The _Xplorer_I_ crew dove into a flurry of activity over the next two
weeks.  After assembling the rest of the cargo modules into a long
chain, they mated the 767 to the rear and drove the entire assembly
into interplanetary orbit.  Meanwhile, they passed from Breaking News
to Established Fact, and vanished just as quickly from the media
radar.



T + 54 days    nobody must have to work

"Whoo-hoo!"

Alister barrelled down the module at the speed of a racehorse, his
arms flailing wildly.  He pulled them in to his sides and made his
body rigid as he sailed through a mating node into the next module.
Now he waved his arms in front of his face.

"Ahhhhh!"

Again he pulled his arms in to his sides, passed another mating node
and began gyrating wildly.

"waHHHH!"

He tucked, grabbed a handlebar as he flew into another module, and
spun around into a pullup that he released with just enough backward
momentum to keep him from floating free.  Droplets of sweat from his
forehead kept going, spraying out over the rest of the crew.

Alister: "What's that smell?"

Vic: "Soy beans...
Andrea: from the garden!"

Alister: "Soy beans?"  Alister questioned, imagining the pressed
blocks of tofu he passed by in the supermarket.

Vic: "I rather like them steamed," Vic replied, as the microwave oven
beeped.

Alister: "I don't know about this... I'll eat them, though!"

Vic: "Ever been to a sushi restaurant?"

Alister: "Sure, I love sushi!  Where's the tuna hand roll?"

Vic: "Ever had those green beans they serve as appetizers?"

Alister raised an eyebrow and the doctor nodded affirmatively as he
opened the steamer and let some of the cooked soy beans float out,
along with an ample quantity of steam.  The aroma of freshly steamed
vegatables permeated the air.

"What have we got here?" the captain asked as he floated in with Burns.

Mercuriou: "Are these from the garden?  Great!"

"Did you see this?" Mercuriou asked as he munched, handing a tablet to
his first officer.  The latest news updates from Earth had brought
word of a pipeline explosion in Nigeria that had killed hundreds
scavenging gasoline from an illegally tapped pipeline.

Mercuriou was grinning.

Mercuriou: "Lycurgus would have approved."

Andrea: "You can't be serious."

Mercuriou: "Why not?  The African capitalists want to pump oil and ship it to
America while their own people starve.  What's wrong with a little
'competition'?"

Andrea: "Speaking of competition, how did you get to be captain?  Why
not Burns?"

Burns, furthest from the door and enveloped in a haze of marijuana
smoke began to guffaw loudly.  He was wearing one of his favorite
T-shirts, solid black except for a single word across the front, in
neon-green [BETTER COLOR] letters formed from a series of wide
horizontal lines, like you might see on a TV screen: MUTE.

Burns: "Because most bosses just want to suck as much work out of you
as they can.  Marc asks me what I need from him, and tells me what he
needs from me.  As big as this thing is, it's a lot easier than most
of my jobs when I didn't get what I wanted or needed.  Who wants to
write another stupid routing protocol, anyway?  I just don't give a
shit anymore what 'the customer' wants!"

Vic: "What are you, a reporter now?  You trying to draw everybody's
life story out of them like this is some kind of drama?"

Andrea: "I'm no reporter, but I usually have the opportunity to get to
know a crew before we're blasted into space together.  Take you;
sounds to me like until this gig came along, you were just siting up
in the hills growing pot."

Vic: "Well, I'm pretty good at growing pot, and the best part is I
don't have to deal with HMO's!"

Andrea: "And you!  What's Mars?  the biggest platform you could think
of to broadcast your ideas?"

[TRANSITION.  GET RID OF ROME]

Mercuriou: "William Gibson thought that Christianity was a major
factor in the destruction of the Roman Empire.  At first the Romans
were Pagans, they gloried in the martial arts, taught their children
the virtues of war, worshiped gods like Mars and Jupiter.  Then came
along the Christians, everybody started turning the other cheek and
forgiving their enemies, before long, no more Roman Empire."

Andrea: "Well, I'm sure the incompetence of their emperors, none of
whom had any intention of turning the other cheek, had a lot to do
with that.  Yet Christianity isn't a religion of the here and now.
It's a religion of the future, not only of a life beyond death but
also of a world beyond this one."

Mercuriou: "That sounds good, Andrea, but faith in God didn't get any
of us here.  None of the companies that sold us this equipment did it
for love or generosity.  They did it because they thought they would
get something out of it for themselves.  We got here because we were
willing to take it."

Andrea: "That's funny, Marc, because I don't remember taking anything
from anyone.  Faith in God got _me_ here."


T + 107 days    there must be a sex scene

The club was packed.  Colored beams of light flirted with the
twenty-something revelers on the dance floor as strobes pumped with
the beat and lasers scanned above the fog that filled the room.  By
the bar and in the alcoves, older men flirted with the youth.  The
crowd, high on liquor and pot, sweat and sex, moved and vibed with the
latest rock/rap hit.

	games are addictive
	games are insane

Alister weaved and bobbed with a twenty-year-old brunette wearing a
tight white top and blue slacks.  She brushed against him as they
twirled and then pressed her head against his chest.  Breathing deep,
he inhaled her fragrance and squeezed her tight.

	games waste your time
	games waste your brain

"You know what?" she whispered in his ear, "I want to see you in your
underwear!"  They kissed, hard, lost in the crowd, the beat pounding.

	books are the ticket
	books are the tool

"Let's take a shower!" he yelled over the music.  She shot him a coy
look.  "You want to have sex?" she asked.  "No, no, I mean, maybe, I
don't know, I just mean, probably, but I just want to take a shower
with you, I think it'd just be fun!"

	books ain't for nerds
	books ain't for fools

"What the hell are you doing!?" Mercuriou shouted, "You're supposed to
be looking for Andrea Yeats!"

"Wha... what?" Alister blubbered as he jolted awake.

He was alone in his darkened compartment, wearing a pair of headphones
connected to the laptop floating nearby.  Yanking them off, his heart
pounding, he listened intently for the captain's voice, but heard
nothing other than the constant hum of the air conditioner and the
tinny noise squeaking out from the headphones.  He unplugged them from
the laptop.  Silence.

Calming, he stretched and exhaled.  Grabbing hold of a pillow floating
nearby and squeezing it in a tight embrace, he dozed back to sleep.
_Man,_she_was_HOT._


T + 124 days    madness must prevail

Mercuriou: "We _have_ to land."

Andrea: "Why?  Why do you have to land?"  Andrea interjected.  "Why
can't you just go back to Earth?  You've already accomplished more
than any other space mission to date.  _Xplorer_1_ will go down along
with with Vostok 1 and Apollo 7.  So what that we didn't land..."

Mercuriou: "We have to land!" the captain shouted.  "People don't
remember Apollo 7; they remember Apollo 11!  If we don't land, they'll
say we failed.  Then they'll come back a few years from now and make
the first landing on Mars; hell, they'll use our technology to do it,
and everyone will remember Captain so-and-so or Major such-and-such
saluting the first American flag on Mars!"

He now swung his face close to Andrea's and lowered his voice.

Mercuriou: "But they'll be too late!  _I_'m planting the first
American flag on Mars --- face-down in the Martian dirt!"

More than a hundred million people were watching the crew conference
on television.  Now settled into Mars orbit, and with a landing
attempt only days away, most terrestrial cable TV systems now devoted
a channel full-time to the _Xplorer_1_ video feed, which now featured
the main cabin of the 767.  During the crew's sleep cycle, a scrolling
orbital panorama of the red planet's surface had become a standard
fixture on many a TV screen, highlighted by a small colored box
labeled "LIVE - Mars Orbit".

Andrea: "So let them!" Andrea shot back, drawing only a snort in
reply.  "Why do you have to risk everything just to win your private
little war?  Or do you seriously think you can survive down there?"

Mercuriou: "Well, maybe you find this hard to understand from your
cushy NASA perch," Mercuriou continued, his voice dripping with
sarcasm, "but there's a lot of people back home rooting for us to show
the world that you don't have to become one of these ruthless bums to
get something done in life."

Andrea: "Oh, please!  Don't you?  Haven't you?" she challenged him.
"How many billions did _you_ steal, Marc?  How many toes did you step
on?  Don't tell me you haven't become ruthless!"

They locked eyes.

Mercuriou: "We are landing on Mars," Mercurio stated slowly and
firmly, in a no-nonsense command tone of voice.  "That has been a
primary mission objective since day one.  We take the risks as they
come.  If you learn to live with disappointment, she'll never leave
you for another man."


T + 150 days    somebody must die

"We're getting a lot of vibration," Burns reported.

He was seated next to Vic in the 767's cockpit, descending backwards
through the Martian atmosphere with the plane's nose aimed at the sky.
Light engine thrust was being used as a brake.  The rest of the crew
had stayed with the cargo modules; this was just a reconnaissance
flight.

"Is that unexpected?" Vic asked.

"It didn't happen on Earth; I'm slowing down more."

Burns pushed the throttles forward.  They were still more than ten
kilometers high, and he expected the vibration to ease as the rocket
exhaust slowed the vehicle.

"Burns, you, uh, you've got a lot of atmospheric turbulence developing
around you," Mercuriou reported from orbit.

"What's going on here?" the engineer wondered.  "This should be dampening
as we slow down; instead, it's getting worse."

[TAKE A LITTLE LONGER BEFORE WE ABORT]

"I'm aborting," he declared as he pushed the throttles forward.  The
entire ship began to shake like a washing machine.

The 767 was now in a full-fledged Martian storm, with itself at the
center.  In the cockpit, the two men heard a load pop as the rudder
tore away from the fuselage and went careening away towards the red
planet below.

"What was that?" Vic wondered aloud.

A half-dozen alarms on the instrument panel answered his question.
The rudder's hydraulic system had lost pressure and its feedback
sensors had gone offline.  Meanwhile, the 767 was engulfed in the
center of a hurricane with no eye.

The spaceplane lost its equilibrium, pitched back and began to yaw,
overwealmed by the aerodynamic forces of the maelstrom.  The left wing
snapped off the fuselage, and slammed into the battered tail.

In the cockpit, Vic watched the mad swirl of the artificial horizon
like a tank commander watching an armor piercing round headed straight
for his turret.  He glanced over at Burns, fighting madly against the
controls, and a calm peace enveloped his soul as he exploded into
light.

Mercuriou looked at him closely.  "Is that a cliche?"

  "What?"

    "nevermind"

"I saw an angel, mommy!"

_Now_I_get_the_answer_key_...

"Burns?  Burns?"

"This is what Alister recorded on the high-speed film."

Kyle's face disappeared and the video transmission changed into a high
definition image of the doomed 767, seen from almost directly above,
buffeted in slow motion by hurricane wind gusts.

"We've been able to enhance it to clearly show the eddies."

Indead, the monitor now showed strong vortices coming off the running
engines, enlarging and growing, twisting and coalescing into a massive
storm.  Then Kyle was sitting in his usual place in the control room.

Andrea squirmed.  She wanted to see the final breakup in slow motion,
wanted to track what had happened to the cockpit, wanted to see the
storm that had then disappeared like a phantom conjured by a voodoo
priestess. More than anything else, she wanted to ask a question, but
the radio time lag prevented it.

"We don't know what happened.  It looks the engines created some kind
of storm, but nothing in any of our Martian models predicts it."

"I don't think the crash was survivable, so I really have to advise
against your resupply plan.  I know you want to do it, but you
might need those supplies to get home."

"And I'm genuinely sorry for your loss of your friends, Andrea.
Houston out."

The transmission ended and was replaced by the usual screen cluster on
the projector.

The Captain was silent.  After a moment, he left for his cabin





"The rescue module?" Andrea asked Alister.  A cargo module had been
attached to a fuel module and an engine, then docked to A-core.

"It's got everything on our primary checklist, and a couple of things
from our secondary, too."

"Let's see."

She knew everything on both lists, having composed them herself, and
skipped the primary checklist, since Alister said that it was loaded.
That meant they had oxygen, water, first aid equipment, radio
equipment, rescue balls, both large - a good-sized, circular tent when
inflated, and small - two men in spacesuits could just fit into one,
and a small quanity of the remaining military rations.  It was the
secondary checklist she was more concerned with, and not all of it,
but only the part that contained things more valuable, irreplacible.
They had begun to form in her mind a third checklist even.  None of
them were packed except one - a pair of spacesuits.  _Xplorer_1_
would then be left with only two.

"Remove the spacesuits from the rescue module, then launch it."

The rescue module was launched under computer control.  Its engine
fired a de-orbit burn and it began dropping into the Martian
atmosphere.  Twenty kilometers up the engine re-ignited to brake its
decent.  Another, smaller maelstrom quickly developed around it.
Radio contact was lost, it disintegrated in the storm, and another
cloud of debris rained down to the red planet's soil.


T + 652 days

"I'm placing you under a suicide watch."

"You're doing what?"

Mercuriou turned away from the window and confronted his first officer.
Secretly, Andrea was glad to see this reaction, much more so than
quiet resignation, but this she tried not to show.

"You heard me."

The Captain emitted a "Humph", "So what's this suicide watch supposed
to be?  You've got a police guard in mind?"

"Me.  I'm the police guard.  I'm not leaving you out of my sight."

Merceriou took this in slowly.

"OK," he shrugged at last and turned back to the window.

"I've been trying to think of some kind of memorial service for Burns."

After a pause, he nodded.

"I've thought of sending something down to Mars, like burning up a capsule
in the atmosphere, but I don't know if we want to use the fuel."

"Why not?"  Mercuriou said.  "We've got plenty of it."

"Yes, we do." Andrea replied.


T + 653 days

The is another staff meeting.  The Captain was present, but silent.

"We can't assemble the cargo modules without the 767," Alister interjected.
"At least, we can't yet.  I need to run some simulations.  We've got
the cargo modules from the asteroid belt that we rigged to push things
around, but I've got to figure how to get them lined up in a row."

"How do we do that?" Andrea asked.

"I don't know."

The room fell silent.

"I guess I've got to think about it for a while."

"Well, we've got NASA monitoring all of this.  Kyle," she asked the
video camera, "could you give us some help putting the cargo modules
together?  We'll send you copies of the simulation software, and I
think you've already got the manifests."

"We've also got to have some kind of memorial service."

Turning back to Alister, she tried reassure him.  "Don't worry, we've
got a lot of people back home who will help us, and I've got more
hours of spaceflight logged than anyone else here."

Alister furrowed his eyebrows.  It was the first time he had thought
about it, but Dr. Andrea Yeats would for many years hold the record
for most lifetime hours of spaceflight.


T + 654 days

The Captain stopped participating in staff meetings.  He respected
Andrea's 'suicide watch' by remaining in the room, but Alister and the
women from NASA did all the work, or more precisely all the work on
the spaceship, because Kyle's 'mission control' facility in Houston
was now constantly on one of the monitors.  Sometimes Andrea would
just stop and watch it for several minutes, unable to directly
participate because of the nearly hour-long round-trip radio time lag.
They arranged an elaborate system of communications, transmitting each
other a sumary of their progress every hour, then pausing an hour
later to listen to the other's summary, which had been transmitted
half an hour earlier, and then transmitting another.  They also
arranged for an audible alarm to sound if they wanted to interrupt the
other's proceedings.

"Oh, and thought you might want to see this," Kyle announced towards
the end of his 0800 transmission, the first of the morning.

He held a popular American newsstand tabloid to the camera.  A
photograph of their spaceship was overlaid with a drawing of a
wild-eyed seer with deep, penetrating eyes staring directly out at the
reader.

"Apparently some of Nostradomes's quatrains refered to the
_Xplorer_1_ - something about "the great bird crippled in the
night" - looks like the death of your chief engineer is only the first
of many woes to befall you guys, let's see, the first death was caused
by fire, the last death will be caused by ice, and, oh yeah - none of
you will ever make it back to Earth alive."

"Thanks a lot, Kyle," Andrea told the video screen as his voice droned
on.  "When I get home, remind me to read you _your_ obituary over
coffee in the morning!"


T + 657 days

Mercuriou spoke.  The others were silent.

"On Icarus' Wing they flew into the night,
 Dared the foreign shore, descended,
 and met the same fate as all
 When brave fools want their freedom.

 There was no problem; it was only a test flight.

 From below came a blow
 That disrupted their flow
 And blew that craft into debris
 Watched Earth far below and from orbit more near
 Watched amazed, scared, humbled, the last three.

 Now returning they flee
 Tails 'tween their knees
 Praying for a favorable wind.

 Now honor the two, now honor the few,
 the brave, the fool-hardy, or free.
 Who climb into the night, who walk into the light,
 We bid homage, we bid fairwell to thee.

 Watched the world here
 Watched the history books near
 Watched, challenged, and proded, the Diety."


T + 658 days

Alister begins maneuvering the cargo modules.  He can get them home,
but the trip's going to take a lot longer than anyone had planned on.

Without the 767,  all they could do was line up all the modules
in more or a less a row, with one rocket engine in the very rear,
and spend days under light thrust to make a burn.


T + 690 days

Mercuriou paused at the sickbay hatch.  Nobody had opened it since
Vic's death.  He keyed the lock, opened the hatch and pulled himself
through.  Yeats followed behind as the captain began looking for the
ibuprofin tablets.

"So what are you thinking?" she said after a moment.

He answered with a snort as he retrieved the bottle.  "You don't want
to know what I'm thinking."

"Yes, I do."

He looked up at her.  "This part of your suicide watch?"

"No, I really want to know what you're thinking."

He looked back down at the capsules in his hand, dry swallowed two and
shoved the rest back into the container.  Then he floated still and
was silent for a while.  Encompassing sickbay with a wave of his arm,
he answered.

"I knew this thing was dangerous.  I guess I just always figured if
somebody was going to die, it was going to be me, so... so what,
right?  I didn't think it would be my best friends."

"We all knew it was dangerous..." she started to answer.

"No.  You were right.  I've cut so many corners on this thing, this
mission, I might as well have reached out and killed them myself.
I... I just don't...  I just should never have come."

Andrea lowered her voice, moved closer, and took Marcelius Mercurio by
the arm.

"Look, let me tell you something I've never really told anyone.  I've
been on two space shuttle launches, and watched a dozen more from
Mission Control.  And every time, I mean _every_time_ they say 'Go at
throttle up'..."  Her voice drifted off and she choked back tears.

"You know why Challenger blew up?  The engineers knew it was too cold
to launch.  But the managers thought, well, maybe we can let it slid a
bit this time, it's always worked before, no big deal."

"Everyone cuts corners," she continued.  "People cut corners driving
their cars - 'oh, I'm not that tired, I'll be OK to drive' - people
cut corners at work - 'it'll be OK, we need to get it out by the
deadline' - people cut corners at home - 'Johny'll have another ball
game next week, I'll make that one'.  People cut corners all the time
- it's a fact of life," she emphasized as he shook his head and pulled
away.

"Not when people's lives are at stake," he answered.

"So you're a perfectionist," she stated in a matter-of-fact tone.

"You're damn right I'm a perfectionist," he shot back.

"And they died because you weren't perfect.  Your plan wasn't perfect,
your ship wasn't perfect, and you weren't perfect."  He looked her
right in the eye.  "But _I_ knew your plan wasn't perfect, and I came
anyway.  And they knew it wasn't perfect, and they still followed
you."  Now he looked down and away.  "And we both know _you_'re not
perfect... but you're here for a reason, Marc.  Just remember that."

"Look, I guess you can forgive me... I just don't know if I can forgive
myself.  I mean..." his voice drifted off.

"It's over.  It may take you a long time to forgive yourself; heck,
you'll _never_ forgive yourself, but it's over.  How do think we felt
after _Challenger_?  You made a mistake and people died, but now it's
time to go on."

"And it's a bit easier since we've only one place to go."

"OK, we've got OMS-17 now," Alister announced.  He, along with the
Andrea and Mercuriou, were suited up and strapped in.  Alister was
operating the computer that controlled the big-screen display.  The
others had their own computers, and Andrea was glancing back and forth
between the big screen and the checklist on own.  Mercuriou was
watching Alister on the display as he checked the computer settings.

"OMS-17 is a 37.42 mega-newton burn at 374 by 1 solar at 13:42 on T +
695.  Today _is_ T + 695.  Current time is 13:37 Universal.  Ship's
inertial attitute is 371 by 3 solar, but that... will rotate into 374

OMS-17 has a tappered entry and step cut-off, check.  It is 17 minutes
and 13 seconds in duration, check.  And it will put us on a course
back to Earth..."

He looked back at Mercuriou, who nodded.  As they waited for the
engines to fire, Mercuriou gazed out the window at Mars.

"'He was never to return to the city of his triumphs and defeats',"
he muttered aloud.

"What's that?" Andrea asked.

"Oh, nothing, just something from a book I read."  He motioned to the
sands of the red planet.

"Yeah," she said, discerning his thoughts.


T + 699 days    communism must be preached [Make sure this is a Sunday!]

Andrea had by now received a special dispensation to say Mass on
Sundays, and her televised services, often highlighted by direct
dialog with her congregation of two, had earned her an unlikely
reputation as a space-bourne televangelist.  Today's Gospel lesson
featured Matthew 7:21: "Not every one that said to me, Lord, Lord,
shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that does the will of
my Father which is in heaven."

"This is one of my favorite parts of the Gospel", she began her
sermon, "because it affects one of the deepest rifts in Christianity -
the split between Catholics and Protestants.  Five hundred years ago,
the Catholic church had gotten into the practice of selling
indulgences; essentially telling people that through charitable
donations to the church they could buy their way into heaven.  We have
since repudiated that practice.  Before that occurred, however, Martin
Luther spoke out decisively against indulgences, among other things,
and when he would not retract his statements was expelled from the
Catholic church.  He initiated the Protestant Reformation, founded the
Lutheran Church, and adopted the doctrine of Justification by Faith,
which teaches that salvation is achieved solely through accepting
Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior.  In one form or
another, this doctrine is accepted by most Protestant churches."

"Matthew 7:21, however, shows that Justification by Faith, at least in
its most extreme form, is itself seriously flawed.  Merely mouthing
the name 'Jesus', no matter how piously done, is not a substitute for
actually doing what God wants.  Christ told us the same thing, a
little bit differently, in a parable.  Let's look at Matthew 21:28:"

  "What do you think? A man had two sons; and he went to the first and
  said, 'Son, go and work in the vineyard today.'  And he answered, 'I
  will not'; but afterward he repented and went.  And he went to the
  second and said the same; and he answered, 'I go, sir,' but did not
  go.  Which of the two did the will of his father?"

"Actions speak louder than words," Alister commented.

"Precisely.  There is another passage, not from the Gospel this time,
but from James's letter, that reiterates this point:"

   "What does it profit, my brethren, if a man says he has faith but has
   not works?  Can his faith save him?  If a brother or sister is
   ill-clad and in lack of daily food, and one of you says to them, 'Go
   in peace, be warmed and filled,' without giving them the things needed
   for the body, what does it profit?  So faith by itself, if it has no
   works, is dead."

"So when Christ says that not all who call him 'Lord, Lord' will enter
the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of his Father in
heaven, not only is it an amazing suggestion, that God actually has a
will for each and every one of us, all six billion of us, but it
provides a simple statement of what our goal should be in life - to do
the will of God."

"This, of course, is much easier said than done, to the point where
_discernment_ - discerning the will of God - has become a buzzword in
religious communities.  Some advocate meditation, St. Ignatius
developed a lesson plan, Vic's technique was the vision quest.
Solitude, silence, prayer and fasting are common features shared by
almost all.  Another approach is based on the parable of the talents:"

   "Again, it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his
   servants and entrusted his property to them. To one he gave five
   talents of money, to another two talents, and to another one talent,
   each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey. The man
   who had received the five talents went at once and put his money to
   work and gained five more. So also, the one with the two talents
   gained two more. But the man who had received the one talent went off,
   dug a hole in the ground and hid his money."

   "After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled
   accounts with them. The man who had received the five talents brought
   the other five.  'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with five
   talents. See, I have gained five more.'"

   "His master said 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been
   faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many
   things. Come and share your master's happiness!'"

   "The man with the two talents also come.  'Master,' he said, 'you
   entrusted me with two talents; see, I have gained two more.'"

   "His master said 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been
   faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many
   things. Come and share your master's happiness!'"

   "Then the man who had received the one talent came. 'Master', he said,
   'I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown
   and gathering where you have not scattered seed. So I was afraid and
   went out and hid your talent in the ground. See, here is what belongs
   to you.'"

   "His master said, 'You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest
   where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed?
   Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers,
   so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest.'"

   "'Take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten
   talents. For everyone who has will be given more, and he will have an
   abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from
   him. And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness,
   where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'"

"In this passage, we find more autonomy - we are given talents and
it's up to us how to invest them, rather than asking God to send us a
portfolio.  Rick Warren developed this approach in
_The_Purpose_Driven_Life_.  He encourages his readers to look at their
own skills, their own interests, their own limitations - in short,
their own gifts, and achieve discernment by asking how best to invest
them.  Whatever the method, the attitude is that of a servant, and the
goal remains the same - to do the will of God."

"I haven't done the will of God," Mercuriou stated in a flat tone.

Andrea paused.

"I don't know about that.  You've made your mistakes, but you've also
said things that needed to be said, and found a platform from which
they were heard.  Now, did you need to steal a billion dollars to do
that?  I doubt it.  I think you could have found another way.  This is
why I don't buy the Christians who say you have to fight violently
against evil.  First off, it's un-Biblical -
_resist_not_he_who_is_evil_.  Second, if there was ever a time when
you could have justified a revolution, it was two thousand years ago
when slavery was as commonplace as money, paganism was the religion of
the masses, and Rome was the terror of the Mediterranean.  Yet Christ
didn't condone any revolution; didn't lead a protest march on the
governor's residence; didn't stage a sit-in at the slave auction.
Didn't do a thing to oppose his own murderers, and didn't let his
disciples oppose them either.  What he _did_ do was teach; and in the
beginning of John is this beautiful passage about the Word.  'In the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
God.'  Why the Word?  Because the Word is the weapon of the Christian,
and the pen is mighter than the sword / books are the light of the
world / free speech is greatest weapon in the world."

"But if you don't believe in Jesus?"  Alister asked.  "Who's going to
listen then?"

"Well, people used to believe the Earth is flat.  You can believe
whatever you want; the fact is that the Earth is round.  Now I believe
that Jesus [of Nazarath] returned to life after three days in the
grave.  Maybe he did, maybe he didn't, but it's like the Earth being
flat or round.  People can debate it one way or another, but it's a
factual question, and ultimately either true or false.  I think it's
true - the resurrection was God's ultimate stamp of approval; it was
his way of telling us that we need to take Jesus seriously."

Alister had been seriously reading the Bible for the first time.
Along with the rest of the crew, he had been receiving plenty of email
from fundamentalists.  Most of the _Xplorer_1_ crew deleted it along with
the rest of their junk mail.  Apparently Alister did not.

"Do you think we're living in the End Times?" he asked.

"Well, first of all, I don't pretend to understand the book of
Revelation.  Beasts with seven heads, strange numerology...  People
attach all kinds of meanings to it.  But I'll tell you this.  Even a
cursory reading of Revelation shows that it's not about the end of the
world."

"It isn't?"

"What happens at the end of the book?"

"There's like a thousand years of peace, right?"

"So at the very least, we can say that it's about a period in human
history torn by war, oppression, deceit and disaster, that ends with
the triumph of good.  So I don't even think about the End Times; I
know people call it that, but I think about Revelation as more like
the Transition Times."

"But aren't people going to be judged then?  What do you have to do to
be saved?  Everybody says something different."

"Well, that's the nice part.  Revelation doesn't tell us how to live;
the Gospels do that, and in fairly plain language, at least compared
to Revelation.  That's why I don't pay too much attention to
Revelation.  Maybe I should, but when I read the Bible, it's usually
the Gospels, because that's where Jesus tells us how to live.  And the
basic rules are pretty simple: Love God - unconditionally, and love
your fellow man - unconditionally.  And maybe everyone says something
different because even though that sounds easy, it can be really tough
to figure it out in practice.  Just like our Gospel reading today -
easier said than done."

"Worry about your relationship with God; get that straight first, and
the rest will follow."

"Relationship with God?  I've stolen who knows how many billions of
dollars, gotten my two best friends killed, and am going to be sitting
in a jail cell for the rest of my life.  I don't think there's much
hope left for Marc Mercuriou."

They're just reclining in zero-gee, talking quietly.

"You're looking at the past and the future, and you're looking at it
from a mortal perspective.  Start with the present."

Mercuriou waved his hands, gesturing around him.

"We're floating in an air-conditioned tube with nothing to do and no
way out.  That's my _present_."

"An excellent opportunity for prayer and meditation."

"I don't know what to pray about."

"You just gave me a nice little list!  Forgiveness for the past;
guidance for the future -- two of the most important things for
anybody to pray for."

"Forgiveness?  For me?  I don't know about that."

"Marc, one of the central tenets of my religion is the
_total_forgiveness_of_all_your_sins_."

Mercuriou stared at her in silence.

"To obtain that forgiveness, we need only ask God in prayer."

"So a murderer, a rapist..."

"If the prayer is sincere and persistent, yes."

The two astronauts floated in silence for several minutes.  Finally,
slowly, Mercuriou nodded his head in assent.  Awkwardly, he clasped
his arms around a hand strap, kneeled against the bulkhead, and was
silent.

"Do you want me to leave?"

"No," came the immediate answer.  He sighed, bowed his head, paused
again.  Finally, in a low voice, he spoke.

"Dear God, forgive me my sins."

"I think you should consider baptism."

"I've been baptized, Andrea.  I was baptized when I was a kid."

"No, I mean adult baptism, preferably by full immersion in a river or
a lake."

"But you're not a Baptist?!"

"I'm a Christian; I don't think of myself as a Catholic, or as a
Protestant, or as a Baptist.  Baptism is an important part of our
tradition.  Sprinkling an infant with water is a nice gesture, but
it's not real baptism, at least not in the historical sense."

With cork puller still attached, the cork went flying unheaded across
the cabin as the Captain grabed for the plastic cover and slapped it over
the top of the wine bottle.  Even so, several gobs of the red alcohol
went floating into the air, the liquid's surface tension forming them
into perfectly round spheres.  Andrea shook her head.

"You'd think that after two and a half years in space, you'd have learned
how to open a wine bottle without spilling it everywhere."

"What I've learned," the Captain answered, as he spun across the
compartment and swallowed one of the larger floating drops, "is that
if you spill wine in space, it's a lot easier to clean up than on
Earth!"

"Alister, the picnic's starting!"  Andrea called out.

"I'll be there in a minute," came the reply from the next module.

Mercurio spilt only a few more drops as he "poured" the wine into two
wine glasses, each one quickly covered with a flat plastic square.
Drinking from straws was much easier, but an hour earlier, after
Andrea suggested a picnic lunch, Marc had dug into the ship's stores
and produced the glasses alongside the bottle, and Andrea had stood on
tradition.

"Cheers."

They clinked glasses and laughed together as the Captain spilled wine
all over his face as he tried to drink it.  Andrea grabbed a towel.

"You guys should come in here!" Alister yelled, then got up and
propelled himself through the hatchway.

"Well, m-maybe you want to come in here," he stammered as he watched
Andrea trying to clean the wine from Mercuriou's face.

"What's up?" the grinning Captain asked.

"An airplane just crashed into the World Trade Center!"

Andrea: Well, hopefully, nobody was hurt.

Mercuriou:  I'm sure the pilot didn't make it!

Andrea: We'll keep him in our prayers with our lunch.

Well, let's keep him in our prayers.

They gathered around the picnic basket to pray.  Andrea was about to
bless the pilot, but at the last minute reconsidered and blessed the
_people_ in that plane.  Soon Alister was back at the console.

Alister:  Another one!  Another one!

Burns once told Mercuriou that there are no great men, only great
ideas, and that genius is the ability to retrieve those rare gems,
that energy and mass are the same thing, related by the square of the
speed of light.  Why the speed of light?  Why it's _square_?  That was
the fine-cut diamond Albert Einstein pulled from the rough.  Tom
Clancy was such a genius.  Khalid Shaikh Mohammed was another.  Both
men had discovered the same fiery sapphire, that unbenonst to the
masses of mortal men, a passenger jet can be used as a
_guided_missile_.  One genius buried his discovery in the pages of a
novel.  The other held its blazing red light up for the world to see
one terrible September morning.

[ "Another Timothy McVeigh or something," Mercuriou was saying.  "The
[ country is so hated; hell, you can say a lot about me, Andrea, that
[ I'm a thief and all that, but I never did anything like this."

The picnic was forgotten.  At 1431 GMT, September 11, 2001, after
first the event on Earth and then a radio lag of 3 minutes 17 seconds,
the silent _Xplorer_I_ crew watched the second tower collapse.  In the
days ahead, it would be revealed that Islamic terrorists had hijacked
four American airlines.  Two had slammed, full throttle, into the twin
towers of World Trade Center, at one time the tallest buildings in the
world, and headquarters to dozens of major companies; a third hit the
Pentagon; the fourth crashed in Pennsylvania.  Burns would have
suggested imagining the pictures you've seen of jet crash scenes, then
trying to project it 100 stories above you onto a skyscraper in lower
Manhattan.  Later, Burns would have made a quick calculation based on
the published mass and height of the skyscrapers to estimate the
energy released by their collapse - ten kilotons of TNT - the size of
a small atomic bomb.  Bankers, mail men, fire fighters, brokers, CEOs,
bus boys - all lost their lives on 9/11.  A pair of glasses, a morning
cold, an early meeting - these became the difference between stumbling
away covered in the white dirt of pulverized concrete or having your
picture appear on a wall of sorrows over the caption - "97th floor,
One World Trade, any information please call..."

Within hours, the nation mobilized.  Medical teams sprung into action,
fire fighters dove into the wreckage alongside men who walked up on
the street and volunteered, desperate to find anything or anyone still
alive in the tons of rubble.  Yet the medics remained largely idle,
and the anticipated stream of causalities into trama wards only
materialized near the Pentagon.

Within days, the world reacted.  NATO invoked its mutual-defense
clause; a French newspaper declared "Today, we are all Americans"; the
British prime minister flew to America.

Within weeks, President Bush fingured Al-Qaeda as the culprit,
declared "either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists",
then bombed and soon invaded Afghanistan.

Within months, all of the old divisions had flared up again.  The
President was gearing up for another war, this one against Iraq, and
foreign opinion again swung against America.

In America, a dissident's dream had prophesied disaster for the United
States and war in the Middle East.  In Afghanistan, an Islamic
militant dreamed that his nation defeated the United States in a
soccer match and all of their players were dressed as pilots.  In
Afghanistan, in Pakistan, or perhaps in Khartoum, Osama bin Laden was
smiling.

"Maybe you shouldn't go on TV right now."

Mercuriou said nothing.  He was busy preparing the video equipment for
a transmission to Earth.  He had already begun objecting to the
President's behavior, stating publicly that an orderly extradition
procedure should be followed rather than an invasion.
[ His first
[ officer had further rankled feathers by suggesting that Islam was a
[ religion of war and that the Middle East needed to accept Christ, not
[ democracy.

"Maybe it's not the best time."

"Why?  Because the country's been hurt too bad to hear the truth?"

"I just think maybe you should wait a little while longer."

Mercuriou stopped himself and thought about this carefully.

"Look, it's like claxons going off in a cockpit.  Brrrmpf!  Brrrmpf!
Brrrmpf! Whoop, whoop, pull up!  And if the co-pilot just stays meek
and silent, then the plane's going to crash!"

"No.  You said it yourself, Andrea.  The Word.  It has to be heard.
Turn on the camera, Alister.  Turn it on."

All of his opponents were on the program, arranged on the TV screen in
a montage of boxed heads.  In one corner, Ecks was speechless, unable
to decide if Mercuriou was defending the terrorists or attacking the
capitalists.  Across from him, Wye, red-faced with rage, sputtered
nonsense.  Only Zee remained stony and impassive, and it was he who
answered the space captain now.

"Took advantage of freedom!?"  Mercuriou practically spit the words
out.  "Took advantage of freedom!  You make it sound like anybody can
just walk up to one of these training companies, 'hey, I'd like to
learn to fly a 767'... 'sure, no problem'.  You've got to have _money_
to fly!  How many people listening to this program would love to learn
to fly but _it's_too_expensive_... Took advantage of freedom!  They
took advantage of _capitalism_!  They had the one thing that will make
people say 'yes' in a society that says 'no', 'No', 'NO' - money!
They took advantage of the fact that Osama bin Laden is a
_multimillionare_!"

"Yes, captain, they took advantage of capitalism, they took advantage
of democracy, they took advantage of freedom.  They came here, lived
in this country, supped the abundent fruits of our liberty, then
turned on her like a cur lashing out at the hand that feeds her. [CA]
They took our freedom and used it to murder three thousand people!"

"Well, who you gonna attack?  The political leaders, the President?
They'll just elect a new one and keep going, all hot to avenge him,
too.  I mean, who really is responsible?  Isn't it the people,
themselves?  Isn't that what they keep screaming, that it's the people
that run the government?  The majority that elects these guys?  Since
it's _the_people_ who run democracy, shouldn't we hold _the_people_
responsible?  And isn't that who was in the World Trade Center?"

A new voice joined the debate.

"Certainly not all of them.  The attack was completely
indiscriminate."

"Completely indiscriminate!  Completely indiscriminate!  The attack
was directly focused on the biggest symbol of capitalism on this
planet!  I mean, those people in there were _the_true_beleivers_!
They were the _capitalists_!"

"I'm sure there were window washers there, too."

"OK, fine.  A lot of innocent people died, and a lot of firefighters
trying to save lives.  But the majority of the people in those twin
towers represented the majority of the people of the United States.  I
mean, this kind of crap!" he gestured to the television monitor.  "All
we keep hearing about is this is what the majority wants, this is the
voice of the majority, the majority, the majority, like they're the
only ones that count!  Well, _the_majority_ of the people in those
towers was _the_majority_, and they didn't come to work that morning
to help make the world a better place, they were
_in_it_for_themselves_ because _that's_what_runs_democracy."

"It doesn't make a difference."

"It doesn't make a difference!?!  And on God's earth, why, woman, why?"

Earth-bound television viewers were witnessing a bizarre display.
Ecks, Wye and Zee had fallen silent, while Merceriou carried on an
animated discussion with the unseen Andrea Yeats.  Only her voice
could be heard from off screen.

"Because you _forgive_your_enemies_, as I've only tried to tell you
about a thousand times [CA]," Andrea was becoming irate.  "You don't
smash airplanes into their skyscrapers because they imposed some
global capitalist system on you, you don't steal a billion dollars to
get what you want, and you don't go off invading foreign countries
because they don't turn terrorist leaders over to you when you bark
out your dictats."

"Maybe they're just incompetent," Alister interjected.

"Incompotent?" Mercuriou answered.  Yeats, too, raised a puzzled eye.

"No, really, maybe people just don't know the difference between right
and wrong.  Maybe they can't choose good leaders because they don't
know how."

Mercuriou said nothing, but the expression that ran across his face
told him to be in accord with the young man's words.  Andrea broke
the silence.

"It's very hard to tell the difference between right and wrong,
Alister.  That's why Christianity is so important.  It gives us just
about the only guideposts we've got to find that difference and make
those decisions."

Zee: The people of this country, the majority - the _moral_ majority -
they can tell the difference!

Andrea: Remember, governor, the path to salvation is narrow...

Wye: You're a tyrant, Yates, a tyrant!  You're a self-righteous
hypocrite who thinks you and you alone are moral enough to dictate to
the rest of us!

Andrea: Senator, I'm not moral enough at all.  None of us, myself
included, should dictate to anyone.  We all have to look to God to
find these answers.  I'm just pointing out that Christ seemed to take
a dim view of most people's ability to do that.


Mercuriou was silent for a moment.

"There's a lot of young men dying in that country right now because
they're going to do what they've been told all their life, that their
country is under attack, and it's their duty to defend it, and
everything our boys have been told and believe!  And this guy, this
president, he doesn't declare war, he doesn't attempt some extridition
process, he doesn't try to get a security council resolution, he just
declares, 'if you're not with us, you're against us', and just barks
out this order to hand over bin Laden!  I mean, the same stupid thing
that started World War I!  And where was all the screaming then, that
Austria had been attacked by _terrorists_, _TERRORISTS_ I tell you,
and their allies - Russia, France, English, and THE UNITED STATES were
supporting _TERRORISM_!!!"

"My God!" he exclaimed.  "Can they really not figure it out?!  Can
they really not see that capitalism is one of the most depraved
/ utterly immoral
philosphies that has even been proposed for men to live?!  Can they
really believe all their own propaganda and think this thing is some
kind of utopia?  I mean, which is worse: fascism, based on just
conquering your neighbors; communism, based on overthrowing your
government in some revolution; or capitalism, based on just doing for
yourself and letting some _invisible_hand_ take care of the rest?"



"Yeah, like me trying to fly this spaceship.  Incompetent."

The crew broke out in laughter as his self-defacing humor.  Encouraged,
he went on.

Alister's voice clipped off the final seconds, then the computer
began the insertion burn.  The slight force from the engine
pushed the crew gently backwards into their seats.  The
computer screen next to the engineer showed their current
tragectory, in blue, an open hyperbola that skittered out
off the screen, and their target tragectory, a neat red
circle centered on a green disk that represented Earth.
As the engines fired, the blue line began curving more
strongly back towards the direction they were coming from,
as another clock ticked down more seconds.

"Orbital interface in five, four, three, two, one, Earth orbit."

The blue line flicked neatly into a broad ellipse.  Alister breathed a
sigh of relief.  Almost nothing, short of something absurdly
catostraphic, like crashing into the atmosphere, could stop them from
getting back to Earth now.  Even if the engine failed now, they would
be in some crazy orbit that the OTV's could get them down from almost
no matter what.

"ECO in five; four; three; two; one; Engine Cutoff."

The thrust stopped, just as the blue and red lines had merged into a
single yellow circle.  They were siting in a circular, six-hour
parking orbit above the heart of the African continent, clearly
visible through the OTV's portholes.

"Perfect burn," Alister declared, as he broke out into a wide grin and
let out a whoop.  "I almost expected a disaster."  (did you really?)

"Sometimes you make it back alive, Alister," Andrea declared as she
unbuckled.  "I've done it twice already."

[ "There's South Africa!" the young man whooped, pointing out the ]
[ window. ]

[ "There's South Africa!" ]

Later that day, Mercuriou gathered his crew for an announcement.

"I'm running for President."

After a moment of silence, Alister reacted first.

"Of the United States?"

Mercuriou nodded solemnly.  Andrea furled her brows.

"You don't expect to win, I don't think?"

"As a matter of fact I do!  I said that I'm running, but I'm not
running their way... I'm running my way!"

Any reaction this would have prompted was interrupted by Andrea's mobile.

"Good news, girl!" it squawked.  "We're bringing you home on
_Columbia_!"

Ecks: I've got some people here on the phone to talk to you.  They're
Hawaiians, and not all of them seem very keen on your plans.  Let's
start with Beth in Mililani, Beth, you're on the air!

Beth: Yes, I'm a small business owner; I own a dry cleaner and I'd
like Mercuriou to know that I can't afford to give away my services
for free.  I'm not some rich capitalist; I have employees that count
on me for a paycheck, and there are some months when they get paid and
I don't.  He's up there in a space capsule, down here on Earth people
just can't afford his dreamy ideas!

Mercuriou: Well, it's about making sacrifices for what's important to
you.  If it's important to live in harmony with God, to treat others
as we're taught by Christ...

Beth: Look, I'm a Christian, but that doesn't mean I have give away my
livelihood so I can live like a bum on the street!

Mercuriou: Why is it, that when so many people say that they're a
Christian, the next word out of their mouth is "but"?

James: "I also run a small business.  I can hardly feed my own staff
because of taxes!"

Mercuriou: "If it's up to me, I'll abolish taxes!  Will you feed the
hungry then?  We'll see!"

Jill: "I don't care what your stupid economic ideas are; what I like
is this political stuff!  You want to turn back the clock 100 years!"

Mercuriou: "That depends on your goal!  Are you trying to put one
group in power or do you truly want a balanced and representative
government?"

Jill: "We have a balanced government!  You want to go back to some
kind of religious oligarchy!"

Mercuriou: "I do not!  The executive is one branch of government, that
is all!  Do you think the majority is entitled to rule over every
branch of government, or do you want balance?"

Jill: "I want... I want elections!"

Mercuriou: "Well, you'll get them for the legislature, that's it!"

Jill: "This is what I'm talking about... you want us to go back 100
years!"

Mercuriou: "I want us to go forward!  I want us to lose this crazy
notion that everything had to be governed by elections and that the
majority, somehow this one group of people are entitled to rule the
world!"


T + 974 days

"Do you support the War on Terror?"

Andrea: "I don't support any war.  Christ taught us to forgive our enemies,
and that's exactly what we should do.  In one sense, it shouldn't
be that hard since the men who actually carried out the attacks
died along with everyone else.  It's time to bury the dead,
mourn over the victims, clean up the rubble, and really ask
ourselves why our country is so hated that people would do
this to us.  And that answer is pretty clear, I think."

"Dr. Yeats, what is the answer?  What do you think the U.S. should do
next?"

"I think we decide to really help the people of the world instead of
just talking constantly about (money and) politics.  Let's take all
this technology, publish everything we know about how it works, make
all that information freely available on the Internet, help third
world countries develop their own microchip manufacuring facilities,
their own chemical plants, their own robotic factories, etc.  Of
course, that means giving up our 'competitive advantage' that we hear
so much about.  It means helping people feed themselves, helping them
educate themselves, helping them build their own infrastructure,
instead of constantly talking about freedom while we pursue our own
selfish ends."

"What about the heroism of the hijackers?  What about the heroism of
the young men who were willing to give their lives because they
beleived that they were acting in their people's best interest?
There were probably the only people who got on those planes that
morning because they were trying to do the will of God."

"Why aren't they heros?  We hear constantly about the heros who are
bombing Afghanistan; why are they heros and these men aren't?  I mean,
they were willing to sacrifice their lives for some greater good;
isn't that heroism?  What difference does it make whether the evil
they were trying to fight was capitalism or terrorism, or whether it
really is evil, or if they just beleive it in their minds, or if
terrorism is really heroic, or if war on terrorism is really heoric?
Isn't heroism about giving of yourself for someone else, and even
if it's misguided, isn't it still worthy of our respect?"

Mercuriou: "I don't think we need all these security restrictions.
First of all, most of them wouldn't have stopped the terrorists
on 9-11.  They didn't have guns, or bombs, or chemicals of any kind.
And, frankly, a knife is so easy to conceal; I mean, you can take
a sharpened stone that won't trigger a single metal detector,
jam it into the sole of your shoe or something; it'd be so easy to
get knifes on board the airplanes.  I doubt you even need weapons
of any kind.  A half dozen men well trained in martial arts is
probably good enough."

"So how can we stop future attacks?"

"There aren't going to be any future attacks, not like this.  We saw
that in Pennsylanvia.  It took about an hour for the rules to change.
It used to be, if someone hijacked an airplane, you just put up your
hands and said, 'OK, where you want to go?  Claim your responsibility.
Make your demands.'  Now, that's all changed.  The passengers and crew
won't let hijackers take over a plane again.  They'll crash it first.
So there just aren't going to be any more attacks like this one.
That's why they used four planes; they knew it was a one-shot deal."

"So we should just do nothing and let the terrorists win?"

"First of all, a lot of what can be done has been done.  Like I said,
there aren't going to be any more 9-11 style attacks with airplanes.
Next, there isn't a whole lot you can do.  Especially if these anthrax
letters are the next in a series of attacks.  If each attack is
radically different from the last, if each one exploits a different
avenue of attack, really, what can you do?  Maybe hope your intelligence
people can penetrate the organization or at least figure out how
they coordinate and communiate, that's about it.  Everything else
is just reacting to the last attack."

"This notion that they exploited the freedom of our society is absurd.
They exploited capitalism, and they were able to exploit it because
they were backed by a multi-millionaire.  If they didn't have
thousands of dollars in funding, would the great 'free' society have
trained them on how to fly these jets?  Would the airlines have just
let them fly for nothing while they were scouting them out?  Would
they have even been let on the planes that morning if they hadn't
swipped through a credit card first?  Money is how capitalism controls
people, and if the terrorists hadn't had money, the 'free' society
would have slammed every door shut in their faces."

Mercurio cut him off.  "They would never have been let on those planes
without money.  They would never have been let on those planes.  They
didn't exploit freedom... they exploited capitalism!"

_Columbia_ launch.

"Hey, look what I found!"

The crew was preparing to depart the ship, moving all their personal
possesions, as well as anything they wanted to return with, into the
OTV.

Alister launched himself into A-core wearing a black T-shirt
emblazzened in front with a likeness of Albert Einstein, holding a
marijuana joint in one hand, its smoke forming the letters "E=mc2"
near his head.

"That's one of Burns', isn't it?" asked Mercuriou.

"Yeah, I found it in the electronics lab."

Emblazened across the top was the Generalized Stokes Theorem in its
most abstract form:  (int_dC w = int_C dw)

"You wouldn't understand," read the caption, "it's a MATH 462 thing."

"Andrea!" Brown called in a low voice.  "I need to talk to you."

"What's wrong, David?"  He was clearly agitated.

"This mission is dangerous.  _Real_ dangerous.  Do yourselves a favor
and get back on your OTV while you still can."

"Why?" Andrea wanted to know.  Brown lowered his voice further.

"I had a dream.  More than one.  All the same.  Burning up in space."

He paused while she considered this.

"It was real.  I know it was."

Andrea nodded slowly and signaled for Mercuriou and Alister.  Once
they were together she told them,

"David has very good reason to be concerned about the safety of our
re-entry."

"What reason?" Mercuriou wanted to know.  He shook his head, "you'd
think I'm crazy", but Andrea encouraged him to speak up.

"I've had dreams, premonitions, about the fate of this mission.
We will die on re-entry.  We will burn up in space."

Now Mercuriou paused.  "I have a good - had a good friend of mine who
would take you completely seriously.  More than one, actually," he
said, glancing at Andrea.  "I don't think you're crazy.  Do you think
the ship's been sabotaged?"

"I don't know.  Get back on your OTV.  Get out of here."

Mercuriou laughed... "and go home how?  The Russians?  I'd just sit up
here forever... No, I'm going home."

"Me too," Alister piped up.

Andrea looked at them both and nodded.  "Yes, I also want to go home
now.  I'll take my chances with _Columbia_," she told Brown.

He looked at the other two and, more slowly, nodded.

"We'll take our chances.  Thank you for warning us."

...

"You'll be fine back here.  It's got its own air conditioning
system and it always works fine all the way down."

...

Mercuriou looked at the GPS.  "If something's going to happen, it'll
be any time now.  We're crossing the California coast."

They rode on in silence for a few minutes.

"You know, I think I'd rather be dead anyway.  Otherwise, I'll just
sit in prison the rest of my life.  Who cares if they kill me now?"

After a moment, Andrea shrugged.  "Every foot you set out from your
house could be your last.  I pray that God keep me alive until I've
done his work, and then I'd just as soon he send me on to the next
thing.  I know that sounds harsh, but I haven't lived a life of
luxary, and it's how I feel."

"I want to live!" Alister said.  He looked back and forth between the
other two.  "What?  What?"

In the cockpit, the flight crew was studying a tire pressure warning.

"Does it look like instrumentation?" Chawla asked, leaning forward
from the one of the rear seats.

"Nope," McCool answered after pushing buttons for a moment.  "It's
solid.  Our left rear tires are blown."

Husband: "Now the left gear is showing a barber pole...  We're getting
a lot of aileron trim, too."

Heavy with the interference of reentry [what's it called?], the radio
crackled to life.

"_Columbia_, Houston, we see your tire pressure messages and we did
not copy your last."

Husband ignored the radio, instead pointing to the small yellow lights
that indicated RCS thruster activity.  The right yaw light was lit
solid.

"How long's that been on?" he asked McCool.  "What?"  "That!"

Back in the Spacehab, Mercuriou was quietly explaining how to overthrow
the government.

"Anybody can secede, well, almost anybody, I mean.  You need to form a
political party.  You should hold a convention, too, but, finally, you
have to convince your people to go somewhere on Election Day and just
_demand_ to be heard."

He paused, then continued.  "It doesn't matter if I'm in jail.  Or
dead.  Change; don't change.  They don't need me.  They really don't."

"Hold on, we've lost hydraulics!" Husband announced over the intercom.

The orbiter began to sway and roll as it careened through the air,
uncontrolled by man or machine.

"Tight up!"  Mercuriou ordered.

Mercuriou and Andrea needed only to snap their visors shut to get
"tight", but Alister's gloves were off.  As he started to don his left
glove, he looked up and caught Vic's eye.  He was floating leisurely
in the middle of the SpaceHab, dressed in slacks and a T-shirt.

"Don't bother."

Alister's jaw went slack.

"Vic?!  W-what are you doing here?  You're..."

"So are you, Marc."

The orbiter was now swaying wildly and, once every few seconds,
exposing the top of the fuselage to the direct heat of re-entry as it
swung back around.  They heard a loud crash and felt something brake
loose from the tail.

"There was a piece of frozen foam insulation that broke off the ET
during launch... smashed a pretty good hole in the leading edge of the
wing, right through all that protective heat shielding."

"Was it sabotage?"

His question was punctuated by a ear-splitting crack, as if someone
had taken a pound of linguini and snapped it in half in front of a
microphone.  The cabin pitched to the side as the SpaceHab access
tunnel ripped away from the crew module.  In fact, the entire cargo
bay broke from the forebody as _Columbia_ split in two, with only a
strip of aluminum skin connecting her on the left, then that, too,
broke free.

The lights went out, but they were not long in darkness.  The forward
bulkhead began to glow red.

"This is a good way to go, Marc.  Quick and painless."

The bulkhead blazed white, then morphed into a sheet of flame that
spilled over them, a crushing, foaming ten foot wall of raging red
surf that buried them under an ocean of fire.  They were burning,
Burning, BURNING!!, and then their suits burnt off into ashes which
blew away with the flames.

_Columbia_ was gone.

In a azure haze, they hung above Texas, above them space, and above
space a stupendous light.

Alister: "Wh-what!?"

Mercuriou turned to him as the earth, the sun, the galaxy fell away
beneath them.

"There is no end.  This is the Great Conversation."
