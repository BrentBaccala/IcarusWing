It was a brillent hack.  It was better than the one they did in
college, when the campus news server wouldn't accept posts from the
student lab.  They had recompiled the server with 'gcc', goten a
smaller executable than the original, altered it so that after
printing 502 ACCESS DENIED it went and accepted the post anyway, then
padded the end of the program to make the CRC come out right.  They
wern't using MD5 back then, heck, it hadn't even been invented yet.
Then Burns dug through the engineering and computer science library
for the VAX Architecture Reference Manual, figured how to drop the
student workstations into a diagnostic mode by hitting the little blue
button on the back of the machine, installed packet sniffers on couple
of them, and waited a few days to grab the server's root password as
it went by over an unencrypted telnet.  They went in as root and just
dropped the new server binary onto the hard drive.  It ran for six
months unnoticed, until the staff updated the whole OS installation.
But this hack was even better.

Burns parked his car in the employee lot and walked to the main
entrance, past a fountain spraying water, fronted by a 3-foot-high
corporate logo cast out of concrete - the word "Chesapeake", with the
'k' forming the shape of a sailboat's mast and a blue-and-white color
scheme that cleverly gave the impression of waves breaking on its
namesake bay.  Chesapeake Computer Corporation - depending on how you
measured it, possibly the world's largest manufacturer of routers, the
telephone switches of the Internet, the gray metal cabinets whose fans
hummed in the backrooms of thousands of Internet service providers,
most bearing that same one-word, blue-white logo.

Burns pushed open the plate glass doors, waved to the receptionist
behind the curved mahongony desk that dominated the center of a lobby
formed by potted plants, couches and coffee tables, slid his card key
through the black plastic box to the side of the employee's entrance,
pushed open the door after its lock clicked open, and walked into to a
massive two-story room subdivided into hundreds of cubicles that
dominated the ground floor of the building.  This was Chesapeake's
brain trust, headquarters of the programmers and engineers that
built its flagship products.  Corporate management had wisely
consigned itself to a seperate building across the street.

The key card was real.  Burns was a legitimate employee, number 3504,
hired almost six months before after a job interview that consisted of
little more than technical presentation in front of a conference room
of corporate engineers and managers.  He walked down the mammoth
room's main isle, past a bank of photocopier machines and a series of
cubicles, half of them deserted.  Turning down a side isle, he walked
to the fourth cubicle, tossed his laptop case on a chair, sat down in
front of his terminal, logged in and began reading his email.

"System's going down today, Burns," announced a neatly attired
secretary walking at brisk pace in the other direction down the isle
that backed the cubicle, who often took it upon herself to remind the
absent-minded programmers of the obvious.

"Yep," the programmer replied without turning around.  The company's
main development computer was scheduled for a hardware upgrade today
that would boost its processing power by nearly a factor of ten,
though the use of a faster, multi-processor system.  Half of Burns'
email consisted of brief notes from various employees that they were
taking the whole day off, turning the system upgrade into an excuse
for a three-day weekend.  Burns, on the other hand, had no intension
of being anywhere but in the office today.  He found his job boring,
wanted to be rid of it as quickly as possible, and had no intension of
letting _this_ opportunity slip by.  He finished skimming the email,
shouldered the laptop case while the terminal finished its logout
sequence, and headed for the server room.

A Kerningham virus is named for its inventor, Brian Kerningham, a
respected American computer scientist who demostrated in the early
1970s that a compiler, a program which converts human-readable source
code into the bits and bytes of machine code that actually run the
machine, could be made to perform covert modifications on the programs
it generates.  What's more, if the compiler is itself used to generate
new compilers, as is so often the case with modern computer systems,
the virus could be made to replicate itself from one generation of
compiler to another, effectively disappearing into the billions of
bits on a computer's hard drive.  Such a virus is particularly
effective when used on computer systems using heavily customized
compilers, such as those used by manufactures who produced both their
own hardware and software, and who wanted their software customized to
take advantage of their custom hardware.  Which was exactly the world
of Chespeake.

Burns keyed the door to the server room and walked in.  An economic
boom was in progress, every bunch of twenty-somethings with a neat
program had a startup corporation running, and skilled programmers
were in short supply.  Someone with Burns' qualifications was a
genuine find, and he had quickly gotten the run of Chesapeake's
operation, which was far more concerned with filling the next
multi-million-dollar order and satisfying those customers by cramming
miriads of new features into their products than implementing any real
security against a determined insider attempting to hack their
systems.

Inside the server room, a white-walled room with a elevated floor that
covered a haylon-based fire extinguisher system, the new server
hardware was laid out along one wall, its technicians chatting
leisurely amonst themselves while awaiting the announced time to
shutdown the system.  Burns crossed to the other side of the room,
where he was working on a tricky install of a new high-speed optical
interface in one of the test machines.  Somehow, he just couldn't seem
to get the settings right.

Forty five minutes later, with the main system shut down and half its
components spread across a table, all three technicians were out of
the room for a minute, one to take a soda break, another to retrieve a
power cable from his desk, and the third to answer a phone call from
someone who had already hung up by the time he got there.  Burns had
contemplated taking a shot of J.D. that morning to steal himself for
this moment, but designed that he had to be absolutely sober in case
_anything_ went wrong.

Nothing went wrong.  He practicly sprinted across the room as soon as
the door closed behind the last tech, slapped a cable onto a special
PCMCIA card that had been siting in his laptop for the last week,
plugged the other end into the server's hard drive, powered it, and
hit a three-key sequence on the laptop, which beeped two seconds
later.  Then Burns killed the power before the server's CPU had gotten
out of BIOS, replaced the original cable to the drive, and dashed back
across the room with his laptop.  Since they weren't using a
cryptographic file system yet, they didn't even have to worry about
forging signatures.  It had taken less than 15 seconds.  After the
technicians returned, Burns preserved appearances by consuming another
half hour to finish installing the optical interface, then left.
Buoyed by an air of near invincibility, he practically floated out to
the parking lot, tossed the laptop in the back seat, fired up a
sneak-a-toke cleaverly designed to look like a cigarette, and floored
the rag-top all the way home.

They had been planing it for months.  Well, they'd been talking about
it for years really, but months to actually do it.  They targeted a
major router manufactuer.  Routers, for the uninformed, are the
telephone switches of computer networks, that handle almost all the
data packets and make decisions about how to get data packet X to
destination Y. First, Burns got a job with the company.  It wasn't
hard.
Various ideas
were proposed to hack them, ranging from tapping into the router line
and hopeing somebody will come in and type the password in the clear,
to Burns' pet scheme for an Ethernet wiretap built from a
thousand-plus element phased array to built in the woods across from
the company's office park.  Unfortunately they neither the money nor
the manpower to construct such a device.  Finally, Marcelius Mercurio
stepped in and showed why he was the Captain.  Somebody just had to go
in and get a job with them.  Burns' qualifications were impecable.

At first he just watched the place, as he went about his assigned
coding project - a boring extension to a ten-year-old routing
protocol.  Back at the rented apartment, Marc drilled him for days to
read passwords - Burns looking over Marc's shoulder as he typed and
telling him what he just entered.  They'd drill for an hour each day,
which Marc liked to say way the minimum amount of time to put into
doing something.  It was a big pain, Burns hated it, and turns out
they never used them, but by the end of the month they had every
important password in the place.

They spent the time getting a good look at the development system.
Burns went right for his favorite program - the gcc compiler.  It was
several years old, and he floated a question with
management about updating it, and practically yelped with glee when
he heard the answer.  They wasn't just turning down the idea;
they were dead set against upgrading the compiler.  Since their
routers used several different hardware platforms, custom compiler
configurations were required for each platform.  This meant a lot
of work to upgrade the compiler, which could only be justified
by a significant improvement.  Also, they expressed fear of hackers
putting something "funny" in a newer compiler.

"This means," Burns spurted through a exhaled mouthful of marijuana
smoke, "that we can change the compiler with near absolute certainty
that they won't just upgrade it away in a few months."  He didn't want
to repeat his college experience of an upgrade taking away a favorite
hack.  The stakes were a lot higher, too.

Having settled on the compiler, they set to work on the hack, Burns
doing most of the coding, Marc watching over his shoulder and doing
code reviews.  They had to get it right.  The virus was designed to
disappear into the compiler's binary, recreating itself if the
compiler was asked to re-compile itself, as well as infecting the
target program.  Since they weren't too sure about how they would
alter the router software, they added another feature - a third prong
of the virus, targeted against the operating system kernel, that would
give them a back door.  Marc didn't have a job, so he fixed dinner
every night and generally took care of the apartment.  It was just the
two of them living there, and on weekend nights they'd party with some
of the waitresses from a seafood joint Burns liked to hit for a quick
drink on the way home from work.  On weekends, and some weeknights,
they'd stay up 'till two or three in the morning, smoking dope,
snorting coke, cranking the tunes.  Just like college.

The problem remained of getting the hack into the compiler; probably
the hardest step.  They thought they knew the root passwords, but
Burns wasn't supposed to have them, and the question remained of when
could he successfully use them to hack the main development system.
Log entries are generated when root passwords are used, and while they
could be fudged, it was an extra level of complexity that Marc, a firm
beleiver in K.I.S.S, didn't want to deal with.  Marc resolved the
question - they wouldn't use the passwords at all, but rather waited
until the system was down for a routine maintenance.  Burns made sure
he was in the server room that day,

out of the room for a few minutes.

Now they leaned back and waited.  Marc starting spending his days at
the library, researching various computer companies as well as
starting to make some discrete inquires about land in the midwest.
Burns tinkered with the virus a few more times, but they were already
in, so it was just a matter of copying a file up to the server and
running a bizarre little system call that should just have returned an
error but instead jumped into the file's code at full kernel
privledge.  Burns was really careful every time he used it, because a
slipup would crash the system and that might begin to attract
attention.  Marc insisted that each change was carefully tested before
Burns installed it.  They took a test suite for the compiler, added
several tests to check and verify the correct operation of the virus,
and ran it against every proposed update to make sure everything was
working flawlessly.  If they found a problem, or added a new feature,
they added a test case to make sure it didn't crop up again.  They
practiced better software design on the hack than anybody in the
company did on their software.  They had to - they couldn't afford a
bug.

Burns got sick of the job and quit.  He had never taken the job
because he liked it.  Told his boss he'd had a better offer elsewhere,
which wasn't unusual in the prevalent economic environment.  Declined
to discuss it.  Was offered a raise.  Politely refused.  He offered
two weeks more work.  Politely declined.  They handed him his last
paycheck and he walked out the door for the last time.

They'd come to regret that later, but Burns was never very good at
working on a boring job.  He'd either find other people to pass it off
to, or drop it entirely.  Mercurio didn't like this tendancy, but had
learned to deal with it over the years, and knew he had to keep Burns
supplied with a steady stream of new challenges, so he let it pass.

Three months later, the manufacuer released the first production
version of their router software unwittingly compiled with the hacked
compiler.  That meant that the software was hacked, as was any
customer who downloaded and used it.  Many did, both because software
had a deserved reputation for poor quality, necessitating frequent
updates, and because the company was constantly adding new features.
This release had an additional feature they didn't count on.  It
allowed a carefully formed packet to run arbitrary code on the router.
Burns kept improving the hack.  Since almost all the routers were
somehow connected to the net, he could get away with this even though
he no longer worked for the company.  Soon, he could wiretap the
routers, retreieve their passwords, add new passwords without them
appearing in any configuration files, generate connections that
seemed to appear out of thin air, and generally infiltrate any
network using the company's routers.

Their first major target was a manufactuer of Keno software.  They had
toyed with the idea of hacking a bank, but both men reasoned that bank
security would be very tight, neither had any inside experience
working at a bank, and a hack that made money appear out of nowhere
would be very suspicious to auditors.  Instead, they settled on
Keno.  They went for a very subtle hack, that replaced the
random number generator with one of their own, and Burns couldn't
surpress a smile under his face a month later as he sat in a bar and
watched the numbers came up on the screen.  They matched the list he
had drawn up the night before.

WE NEED A SEMI-PLAUSABLE SOURCE OF SOME MONEY BY NOW

The break can within six months.  The Kansas state jackpot in the
Pick-Five-Plus had risen to over $11 million.  Marc knew the numbers
would hit.  What kept him up all night was the thought of somebody
else picking the numbers at random.  Nobody did.

Vic had picked the winning ticket, and the doctor revealed in the
limelight.  For the first time in his life, he was in front of
T.V. cameras.  He told his story, his bills from medical school, his
work for the doctors, his work for the clinics, his general
disillusionment with medicine.  "Everyone grips about H.M.O.s and
professional assocations and the cost of medical insurance," he told
one press conference.  "If the doctors would just forget about the
money and heal the people who came to them, we wouldn't have all these
problems."  One reporter asked him if he was going to start a medical
philanthropy with the money.  A little grin washed over his mouth and
his mustashe bristled.  "Actually, I'm starting a dot-com".

They called it Robotics Research.  Which wasn't far from the truth.
Marc certainly planed to do a lot of work robotically.  He was also
careful to keep the company's cash burn under a half-million a month,
even considering things like his deal to purchase 60 PCs and 60
laptops for a hundred thousand, complete with wireless networking
cards.  Wireless cards for which they had a amplifier design.  They
just stamped out a small run of 150 circuit boards and soldered them
on.  The dozen young programmers they'd hired started to find some of
the quirks of their management when a hundred of the computers just
disappeared out the door to a remote location know only as "Site Y".
They were still available over the network, though, and they were
starting to run some pretty serious simulation software that would
keep them running all night.  Mostly Jasper's code, Navier-Stokes
equations, wing design, hypersonic flight, that kind of thing.
Robotics Research accumulated a sizable collection of robots, and most
of the software running them was pretty simple.  Just basic remote
control, really.  Boring stuff, and Marc had to struggle to hold on
to some of his brighter employees.  He gave them an orbital mechanics
system to work with and enhance.  No explaination given what a
robotics company would want with orbital mechanics.  Yet the work was
interesting, so most of the programmers stayed on.

Meanwhile, Marc had still been playing the lotteries.  The hack had
worked its way into both Maryland's and Flordia's systems, and Marc
himself decided to have his fifteen minutes of fame in Flordia, then
had Jasper's mom hit it big.  People who knew them well started to
wonder.  If you somebody you know hit the jackpot, it was a big deal,
but three people?  Questions were already starting to rise when New
Year's came around.  The core team got together at a ski resort in
Taos and went back to a rented ski house afterwards.  Vic, as usual,
was the one to question the lottery winnings, and the increasing money
drain.  Marc just stood in the corner and puffed on a joint.  "This
is the year of living dangerously."

Marc had leveraged the roughly $20 million from the lotterys into
about $100 million using fraduent financial statements to get various
loans for land and equipment.

Marcelius Mercurio crested the embankment in his ten-year-old Toyota
and turned off the state highway onto a paved road that soon became a
dirt road.  It was high summer in the New Mexico mountains, hot and
dry, one of those days that made the ancient Greek scholar wish for a
convertible, the Pacific Coast Highway, and a surf board.  Yet the
Japanese compact had served him well over the years, and though its
engine was nearing 150,000 miles, like many of these Asian imports, it
had never given him more trouble than a broken timing belt.  Now it
cruised over arid hills shimmering in the noon heat, zipped along
between catcuses and sagebrush, and easily negotiated dry washes that
in the spring would become impassable torrents for a few hours, then
settle back into dusty hibernation to await the next storm.  Seven
miles from the highway, Mercuriou turned right at one of the dry
streambeds, shoo'ed away a half dozen cattle with his horn, then
rubbled over a cattle guard, and coasted down a long driveway between
a high cliff rising to his left and the riverbed which paralleled the
road on the right, finally reaching a pair of house trailers at the
end.  He parked next to an old Jeep, the only other vehicle in sight,
turned off the ignition, and got out of the car.

Like many famous men, Mercuriou was neither particularly tall,
particularly handsome, nor particularly well dressed.  In his
mid-thirties and a shade under six feet tall, his facial features
betrayed the mixed features of his hybrid Romanian/Irish ancestry.  A
white T-shirt, khaki shorts, tennis shoes composed his modest attire.
The secret of his success lay more in the intangibles - above-average
intelligence, a love of literature and learning, and a driving
ambition.  Like his paternal ancestors, who had decended from the
Scythian plains to ravage the heart of the Roman Empire, he was
fiercely loyal to his friends, determined to take on the world,
undetered by any temporary setbacks in his plans, and absolutely
convinced that he would ultimately win.

The man who emerged from the nearer of the two trailers was nearly ten
years his elder, heavy set to nearly the point of obesity, with a
bristling mustache that covered a mischevious smile.  Dressed in a
button-down shirt and light slacks, Victor Antonov decended the three
wooden steps in front of the door, began to shake the hand of his old
friend, then clasped him in a bear hug and invited him inside.  They
had met in college, when Marc was an eighteen-year-old freshman and
Vic was finishing medical school.  Marc had briefly dated the future
doctor's cousin. The courtship had foundered; the friendship had
lasted for almost twenty years.

Inside, the twenty-year-old trailer exhibited the domestic disarray of
a single man.  A small siting room to the right of the door was
partitioned from the kitchen by a small counter.  Beyond the sink and
oven, a sliding door lead to a small bathroom and then to the only
bedroom on the far end of trailer, where a gray cat had disappeared
upon seeing a stranger enter the abode.  Marc sat down on a couch
against the far wall while Vic went back out to retrieve a pair of
cold beers from the large refrigerator outside the door.

"So how long have you had this place?" the visitor asked after
the two friends had toasted and taken a first taste from their
bottles.

"Oh, about three years," the doctor answered.  "My father left me
enough of an inheritance to buy this plot of land with the trailer
on it for $20,000.  I added the second trailer myself."

"Pretty good deal."

"Yeah, the land's cheap up here.  Can't use it for much except
cattle; you've got to drill down eight, nine hundred feet or
so to get water."

"And how you've been puting food on the table?"

"Oh, a little of this and that," the doctor answered vaguely, drawing
a wry smile from Mercuriou.  "That's what the other trailer is for."

"Can we take a look?"

"Sure."

The men took their beers and walked back out into the heat, around the
side of the trailer, down a dirt path through the scrub to the door of
the second trailer.  It look much like the first one, except that all
of the window curtains were drawn.  Closer inspection revealed that
white drywall had been placed over the interior off all the windows,
behind the curtains.  It was impossible to see in or out of the
trailer.  Vic used a key to take a padlock off the door and led the
way in.

Inside, the trailer had obviously been stripped of almost all its
original furniture and fixtures.  The main room, about thirty feet
long, was lined on both sides with plastic tubs raised about a foot
off the floor.  Inside the tubs were perhaps a hundred potted
marijuana plants, each sporting a bushy top of their distinctively
branching five-part leaves.  Two rows of bright lights hung down from
the ceiling on chain links that could be adjusted in length as the
plants grew upward.  An air conditioner hummed in the window, and a
dehumidifier on the floor discharged outside the water it condensed
from the air.  The lights ran off a timer, which also periodically
turned on a pump that flooded the tubs with a liquid fertilizer from a
child's toy plastic pool in the corner.  The smell, green and
plantish, mixed with another aroma distinctly reminiscent of a skunk's
spray, was overwealming.

Vic walked around the raised tubs to the far wall, where a quantity of
the plants had been harvested and hung upside down to dry.  He broke
one of the buds off by its stem and passed it to Mercuriou.  It was
top-quality marijuana, never packaged or pressed, covered with tiny
white crystals of the psychoreactive drug tetrahydrocannabinol.  The
guest nodded his head in appreciation, not really sure what to say,
then finally mumbled some kind of complement on his friend's carefully
maintained operation.  As they walked back to the other trailer, Vic
explained how his paying clients provided enough income to run the
operation, subsidize the non-paying clients, mostly patients suffering
from AIDS or cancer, and provide enough profit for food and gasoline.

"I don't really like it," the doctor mussed after he had loaded
part of the marijuana bud into a glass bong filled with water and
ice, passed it to Mercurio along with a butane lighter, then
reloaded the bong and smoked some himself.

"But I tell myself I'm helping people, and I am.  A lot of my patients
are terminally ill, and I get the occasional hangnail or scorpion
bite, but it still feels like I'm siting up here in the hills doing
nothing with my life except becoming something I've always despised -
the local drug dealer," he concluded with a wry grin.

It was an opening in the conversation that Mercurio had wondering
how he'd create since he'd arrived.  Now, intoxicated on the drug,
he leaned forward in his chair and lowered his voice.

"I've got a new project I'm working that really requires a man
of your experience, both as a doctor and as a... horticulturalist."
Both men grinned at this choice of language.

"Actually, it's an old project, but one that's really going to take
off, and I do mean take off."

Vic rolled his eyes, stood up and walked to the kitchen, which in the
small trailer amounted to little more than crossing the room.  As he
took a teakettle off the stove and began filling it with water,
he thought back over the various dreams and schemes he had shared
with Marc Mercuriou.  Only one had a chance of 'taking off',
and it had come up again and again over the years.

"We're not flying to the moon, I hope?"

"Nope.  The moon's been done.  I'm shooting for Mars."

The doctor sighed as he turned on the gas stove and contemplated the
flame.  Mercuriou wasn't joking.  He thought back over the years he
had known Marc Mercuriou.  If he had learned one thing about the man,
it was that he wouldn't undertake a project if he didn't think he
could finish it.  He'd sit and do nothing before undertaking something
half-baked.

"I thought you estimated it would take billions just to fly to the moon."

"Ten billion.  But the money's not a problem."

Vic now turned and looked Mercuriou directly in the eye.

"You've got ten billion dollars?"

"I've got as much money as I need.  I control the Internet."

Mercuriou launched into an explaination of that bold statement,
stopping after he could tell the doctor was no longer paying
attention to the tech-jargon.

"I'm telling you," he concluded in a low voice, "this thing's like
super-hack."

A silence fell over the room, punctuated only by the whistling of
the teakettle and a single word from Vic as he slowly shook his head.

"Burns."

Mercuriou nodded in assent as the doctor slowly poured the water into
a pair of ceramic mugs and carried them into the living room.  His
level of distraction, and perhaps intoxication, was illustrated by his
need to return to the kitchen for the teabags, as the mugs contained
nothing but hot water.

"I'll need some time to think about this," he concluded after several
minutes of silence.

His visitor nodded his assent and left after another half hour of
small talk.  He couldn't help but feel disappointment as he drove off
down the dirt road.  What had he expected, really?  Maybe for the
first time since he and Burns had dreamed up the hack, he really
thought seriously about how crazy the whole scheme was, and
realistically how slim were the chances of success.  Yet he has no
intention of spending the rest of his life the way he spent his last
ten years, fumbling around from one dumb thing to another while a
court settlement ate all his money and his best ideas sat as notes on
a hard drive.

"Fuck it," he said as the car reached the paved road and he hit
the gas.  He'd be damned if he would keep living like he had been,
and if Victor Antonov didn't want in, he'd find another doctor...
and another horticulturalist.

Almost at the same time, Vic was still standing in the New Mexico sun,
watching the road his friend's car had long since disappeared down.
The dust had settled, and nothing disturbed the scene except the
buzzing of insects, which he mostly ignored.

"This," he said in a low voice to nobody in particular, "will require
a vision quest."


T - 355 days

The entire eastern sky was lit a brilliant red hue, as if a frosted
piece of red glass had been slipped in behind the mountains.  Vic,
still lying in a sleeping bag, had been awake for the better part of
an hour, and with eyes closed was calmly awaiting the dawn.  It was
the morning of his fifth day at this place, and though he was looking
forward to the company of people again, he also knew that he would
miss this place.  One of his favorite spots for prayer and meditation,
it was a desert canyon that looked from the air like a single massive
stroke of white slashed through brown hills by a giant's hand.  Pristine
granite boulders were strewn out fifty feet on either side of a
spring-fed river.  Cactus and scrub covered the surrounding land.
Amid patches of sandy beach, swirling pools and murmuring cascades
were two-foot diameter logs wedged between boulders twenty feet above
the water line, mute witnesses to the torrential storms that, once or
twice a decade, filled the arroyo with the raging waters that had
carved out this canyon over the centuries.  The water was drinkable, and a
gentle breeze often discouraged insects.  There were flat rocks to lie
out on in the sun, and shady crevices to evade the heat during the
peak of the day, not to mention the ample bathing spots in the cool
river.

[The site exists as described, but it is not in New Mexico.  It
is on the Baja Peninsula, close to the town of Santiago, Mexico.]

Vic had put this off for several weeks, inventing one excuse after
another why he couldn't do it just yet.  He had to let his clients
know he'd be gone for several days.  He had to find someone to take
care of the cat.  He wanted to finish the novel he was reading.  It
was already too late today.  It was still pretty early, he could
putter around the house for another hour or two before packing the
car.

The truth was, that though Vic had decided to undertake a vision
quest, and knew intellectually that this was the course he wanted
to follow, neither was he looking forward to spending several days
in silence and solitude.  _We're_used_to_all_these_distractions_,
_you_know_.

Time nearly stood still.  Each day seemed to pass like an eternity.
At first you thought about all the things you could be _accomplishing_
right now, instead of siting still and trying to quiet your mind to
discern the will of God, or the Great Spirit, as Vic prefered to call
him.  After a while, you realize that you wouldn't actually be
accomplishing any of those things, but rather filling the hours with
all the _distractions_ - television, food, drugs, games, books,
talking, walking, driving, cleaning.
_This_is_how_long_a_day_really_is_, you eventually realize.
_We_waste_so_much_time_.

Then comes the first night.  Vic usually found it depressing to watch
the last sliver of sun slip away behind the western hills, as the dusk
then slowly settled in.  Yet the nights here held their own splendor,
away from the city lights, as the stars began to emerge, eventually
filling the blackness with thousands of tiny lights in their various
shapes and patterns, many subtly hued and interspersed with dim
nebulas.  Nor was the sky still.  Not only did the stars shift through
the night, but the lights of airplanes high above passed slowly across
the constellations and the occasional unannounced meteor would flash
past in a fraction of a second.

A bright yellow light pierced out from a gap in the mountains and
began to widen into the orb of the sun.  Though conscious of the
light, Vic put off opening his eyes.  For better or for worse, he had
decided to accompany his friend on this mad space venture, and he knew
that it might be a long, long time before he returned to this place.
_Or_ever_, he thought, calming assimilating the danger inherent in
Mercuriou's proposal.  He had not enjoyed an especially fruitful
meditation during this vision quest, but had been constantly
distracted by memories of years past, times spent with Marc and his
good friend Burns when they shared a house together; they as
undergraduates and he as a young resident at the university medical
center.  He also knew, intellectually, that Marc would ask but few
people to join him, and that his skills would be sorely required.

In 1998, John Pople became the first man in history to win a Nobel
Prize for writing a computer program.  It was called _Gaussian_, and
it numerically simulated Schroedinger's equation, the defining
physical equation for explaining the complex interactions between the
electrons and nuclei that formed atoms and molecules.  _Gaussian_, and
programs like it, made it possible to analyze atomic structures in
much the same way as numerical simulations of Newton's gravitational
equations made possible the analysis of planetary movement in solar
systems.  For hundreds of years, scientists had sought the holy grail
of a purely mathematical theory to explain the entire physical
universe.  Like two teams of hunters closing on an elusive prey from
opposite directions, physicists and chemists had pursued this common
quest, the physicists drilling down deeper and deeper into the
mysteries of the atom, the chemists measuring and categorizing dozens,
even hundreds of properties of the myriad array of chemical
substances.  In the early decades of the twentieth century, physicists
like Planck, Schroedinger, and Dirac developed the quantum theory that
could finally explain the layered construction of atoms and molecules,
but it remained for the development of the digital computer to
actually solve those equations for any but the simplest of atoms.  For
the first time, physics was beginning to correctly predict the
physical properties of matter that until then had only been understood
empirically by chemists.

Burns was counting on twentieth century physics for a breakthrough of
the first magnitude.  He dumped the money from the lottery into copies
of _Gaussian_, along with its most elaborately expensive spinoffs and
a team of programmers, including a bright 20-year-old South African
chemist named Alister Compton.  They set up shop south of San
Francisco, in a Silicon Valley office building in Palo Alto, near
Stanford University.  A roaring economic boom kept restaurants, bars,
and shopping malls packed with young, dreamy-eyed twenty-somethings
sitting on thousands of dollars worth of stock options.  Every other
car on University Avenue was either a Ferrari, or a BMW, or a Land
Rover - most of them leased.  Up scale restaurants provided their
patrons with blank paper placemats and colorful Crayons to doodle and
brainstorm their latest propietary server architecture while waiting
for their hundred dollar orders.

Burns set his team to work on his assortment of computational
chemistry programs.  What they were looking for, he explained, was a
new type of liquid rocket fuel.  Many liquid fuels, such as liquid
hydrogen, were cryogenic and required elaborate cooling systems to
keep them refrigerated well below freezing.  NASA, for example, kept
the space shuttle's rocket fuel stored in a specially built
underground tank, and only pumped it into the shuttle's external tank
the night before launch.  Worse, even most efficient liquid fuels had
rather poor specific impulses, that crucial ratio between the force
generated by the propellant and the force exerted on it by gravity,
and also rather poor specific volumes, resulting in the need for very
large tanks to contain the propellants.  Solid fuel propellants
performed better, which is why the space shuttle used a pair of
booster rockets to help propel it into space, but with the severe
drawback that they couldn't be simply throttled back or turned off
like liquid fuel propellants.  Burns wanted to develop a liquid fuel
that would remain liquid at room temperature, eliminating the need for
elaborate cooling systems, and that would have a specific impulse and
specific volume rivaling the best of the solid propellants.

He set his programmers to work installing an array of fast, expensive
computers he had brought to perform the Shroedinger approximations in
parallel, running dozens of computers simultaneously to predict the
melting point, boiling point, ionization energy, chemical potential,
thermodynamic constants, a dozen other predictions that may or may not
be accurate.  Once a promising candidate was identified, the next
question was how to create it in a series of reactions.  Again, the
computers were asked to compute more and more predictions for the
possible byproducts and derivatives of the compound in question, then
reacted in simulation by more programs to find out if such-and-such a
combination producing such-and-such a result would actually proceed
forward in reasonable time at some specified temperature.  Since none
of the software was more than a few years old, really, and since it
crashed constantly, and produced bizarre predictions like its
continued, stubborn belief, much to Burns' great alarm and dismay, that
kerosene would react with hydrogen peroxide at a specific impulse of
298 without the presence of a catalyst.  So the only way to find out
if any of the predictions were even remotely possible, they had to
test them, and Burns set up both a well-stocked chemistry lab and
eventually a small rocket engine on a firing range.


T - 313 days

A round of applause greeted Burns as he stepped to the podium.
Mercuriou had just finished a glowing introduction for his college
friend, and an audience of mainly reporters politely applauded the
chief technical officer of the latest high-tech startup with a big
invention.  NASA, the American space agency, had just awarded them a
major contract.

"Could you describe, in layman's terms," one reporter asked, "exactly
what N-1033 is and what makes it different from conventional rocket
fuels?"

"Sure," Burns answered, warming to the technical subject, and
launching into a well-rehearsed answer.  "First, let me answer the
first part of your question.  N-1033 is a very, _very_, large molecule
with a molecular weight just over 20,000.  To put that in context,
water has a molecular weight of 18, and table sugar has a molecular
weight of 342.  This doesn't mean that a beaker full of N-1033 is
exceptionally heavy, it just means that the molecules themselves are
very large, and thus very heavy, and it doesn't take as many of them
to fill that beaker."

Burns paused to select a computer graphic from the tablet in front of
him and display it on the projector screen behind him.  It showed a
three-dimensional model of his invention, a molecule of the rocket
fuel known as N-1033.

"Geometrically, N-1033 is a large, spherical cage of carbon modules
than form a shell around a core dominated by nitrogen and oxygen.
These nitrogren-oxygen bonds release a great deal of energy
when they break, which is, in fact, exactly what makes nitroglycerine
such a powerful explosive.  We use nitroglycerine in the manufacturing
process.  It's the carbon shell on the outside that protects the core
and keeps ten-thirty-three from simply exploding.  However, when you
raise the temperature several hundred degrees above room temperature,
the carbon shell _does_ break apart, and releases the fuel mixture
inside.  Furthermore, due to the spherical shape of the molecule, it
remains liquid at far lower temperatures than you would expect for a
molecule of this size.  In fact, it's liquid at room temperature, and
these are the properties that make it such a good fuel - it doesn't
require an oxidizer because it's already got oxygen in it; it has a
high specific impulse, which is the most important measure of the
efficiency of a rocket fuel; and it's liquid at room temperature and
thus doesn't require elaborate refrigeration techniques."

"Now, for the second part of your question, I've really already
answered part of it - what makes N-1033 different from conventional
rocket fuels is that the molecule is so large and complex, while
something like the space shuttle runs on liquid hydrogen and liquid
oxygen, which are two of the smallest and simplest molecules that exist.
But more than that, what makes ten-thirty-three, as we've gotten used
to calling it, so different is how it was designed, and I did use the
word _designed_.  We started off with a list of requirements for this
fuel, some basic design ideas that included a carbon shell with fuel
inside, but then used computer programs to simulate the equations of
quantum mechanics and thus try literally thousands of different
combinations to find one that would work.  We actually found many
possibilities that looked like they would work, that's why this one is
numbered ten-thirty-three, but all of the earlier molecules were
rejected for one reason or another."

#if NOT

"What kinds of reasons led to the rejections of those molecules?"

"Well, the single biggest reason was synthesis.  It isn't enough to
just have a computer telling you a molecule is stable, even if that's
true, and sometimes it isn't, but then you actually have to be able to
construct the molecule.  You do that the say way you construct any
chemical substance, which is by a series of chemical reactions that
produce a series of intermediaries and finally gives you the thing
you're after.  Such a series of reactions is called a
_synthesis_pathway_.  We used the computer programs again to predict
various possible synthesis pathways, and a lot of them turned out to
be implausible.  The single biggest thing that sets N-1033 apart from
N-1, or N-2, or N-1032, is that we were able to develop a twenty-three
step synthesis pathway starting with graphite and nitroglycerine that
ultimately produces N-1033."

#endif

Mercuriou, seated now in the front row between a NASA program director
and Burns' empty chair, had tuned out the press conference and was
deep in his own thoughts.  _Now_the_real_work_begins_.

"Captain?" Burns interrupted.  "I mean, Marc, you want to answer that
question?"

A chuckle went threw the audience.  Some thought it amusing that
the CEO was called "Captain".

Marc walked to the podium and pulled Burns aside to 'consult' with him.

"What was the question?"

Burns grinned.

"They want to know again about our patent intentions."

Mercuriou nodded as he turned back around to address the audience.

"Not only are we not patenting N-1033, but we're publishing pretty
much everything we know about it, including the complete synthesis
pathway we use.  Of course, right now we're the only company that has
a production process, so it was fairly easy for us to win the NASA
contract, but I hope in the near future you'll see N-1033 being widely
manufactured and used."

"I frankly don't understand," one reporter asked.  "If you get a
process patent you'd be able to dominate the market for this fuel for
years to come.  Doesn't your company need the money?"

Mercuriou grinned.

"We have ample funding from private sources.  I guess you could just
call it my humanitarian streak."


T - 200 days

Burns was quite busy now with a whole host of design problems, few of
which he could task off to the subordinates they'd hired, and all
requiring detailed attention.  The mass production of N-1033, as part
of a legitimate contract with NASA, was one of the few things he could
task off, and Mercurio had in fact taken the entire N-1033 operation
off Burns' hands, hiring a team of chemical engineers to design the
tanks, piping, reaction chambers, and control equipment of a small
refinery required to mass produce a chemical product.  Since the
Captain dealt with NASA also exclusively himself, made sure he was
present everytime NASA representives were around, and carefully
segregated the designer from the operators of the chemical plant, he
was able to effectively lie about how much N-1033 NASA was actually
buying.  In fact, the company was massively over-producing the rocket
fuel, a detail known to less than half a dozen men despite the fact
that well over a hundred people were involved in the operation in one
way or another.  Mercurio had mastered the military concept of
"need-to-know", and in fact was as brilliant a manager as Burns was an
engineer.

Money was still a problem.  Financial statements could be fabricated,
and loans could cover short-term discrepancies, but the simple fact
remained that, even after a hefty markup, NASA wasn't paying for
anything close to the quantities of chemicals actually being consumed.
Somehow the costs had to be covered.  Burns had wanted to go back to
hacking, but Mercurio had flat out refused this proposal.  Burns'
talents were required elsewhere.  Instead, the Captain assigned Vic,
who had basically nothing to do at the moment, to scout the Internet
for likely targets.  Under conditions laid down by Burns and approved
by Mercurio, his assignment was basically to look but not touch.

For almost a month, Vic spent several hours each day looking but not
touching.  It wasn't boring work.  It's easy to spend hours surfing
the Internet, and Vic was surfing into company's internal networks,
monitoring their web usage, reading private emails, grabbing
passwords, watching supposedly secure logins.  Finally he settled in
to a Delaware-based banking firm called Keystone Securities.  With a
seat on the New York Stock Exchange, Keystone was a mid-sized
financial services broker that specialized in portfolio management for
corporate retirement funds, but was diversified into other banking
operations as well.  Vic's survey of their private financial
statements showed them with well over a billion dollars in assets,
mostly in the form of securities.  Furthermore, they were insured by
FDIC, the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which meant that
stealing from them would effectively be stealing from the
U.S. Government.  Mercurio wouldn't have OK'ed theft from retirees.
On the other hand, he had no problem with the Federal Government
unwittingly underwriting his operation.

The hack was made possible by Keystone's dependance on a IBM mainframe
computer for the majority of their electronic banking operations.
The brokers controlled the mainframe from PCs interconnected
on a private corporate network.  A firewall allowed the PC users
to access the Internet without allowing Internet access to
the private network.  Of course, this design depending on
correct operation of the firewall, manufactured by... Cisco.

The software on the PCs was designed to emulate type 3270 mainframe
terminals, and used unencrypted connections for communication with the
mainframe.  Since the connections were completely within the corporate
network, this wasn't regarded as a security risk by the designers.
Their concern was focused on preventing a breakin from the outside.
Nobody considered the possibility that a deliberate trapdoor might
have been placed among the millions of machine instructions that ran
the routers interconnecting the network.  Worse than the data
connections being unencrypted, they were also unsigned, lacking any
cryptographic signature that the mainframe might have used to ensure
that the terminal sessions originated from trusted computers.
Instead, Keystone's internal network depended entirely on password
protection, which Vic easily circuvented simply by asking the routers
to record the passwords as they went by.

Mercurio knew that a billion dollar hack, unlike their lottery
rip-off, wouldn't go unnoticed.  He delayed until the last minute,
spent every penny of every line of credit he could get his hands on,
made a master list of everything that still needed to be purchased,
and lined up the purchase orders in advance.  He had front
corporations set up in Europe and the Caribbean, with bank
accounts in Lichtenstein and the Bahamas.  He leased
a half-dozen plots of empty land in western U.S. states, selecting
them for both isolation from towns and easy highway access.

....

"Half their currency trading operation is based on arbitrage.  They
look for an eighth-point discrepancy between say, the price of gold
futures in Chicago and the price of gold in London.  It's a guaranteed
win if you can move fast enough to take advantage of it, and that's
why they're so heavily computerized.  The software makes almost all
the trading decisions.  Now, they've built their entire network out of
Chesapeake equipment, so we're in like Flint from that angle.  Also,
they develop all their own software, so we've already got their source
code.  We've got a targeted modification that, when triggered, will
make loosing trades.  Once we're done, we flip the switch again, and
the software goes back to behaving like normal."

"It does have the disadvantage of leaving evidence on the hard disk.
The hack should remain dormant, but will be there if somebody starts
looking hard enough."

....

Finally, on a Friday afternoon, they went in.  First, they had their
hacked routers cut all legitimate connections to the Keystone
mainframe.  Their network administrators knew something was amiss, but
focused at first at the apparent inability of users to login over a
network that appeared to otherwise be functioning normally.  Meanwhile,
the hackers instructed the mainframe to dump nearly every one of
Keystone's NASDAQ securities onto the market, then immediately began a
series of wire transfers to numbered bank accounts as the money from
the sales rolled in.  By midnight, when they returned the routers to
normal, Keystone Securities was effectively bankrupt.  The traders,
being told only that there were network problems, had mostly taken off
early.  The network administrators, puzzled at why the network had
malfunctioned, then equally puzzled as it mysteriously returned to
normal, shrugged their shoulders and went home.  It wasn't until
Saturday morning that the company's partners began to realize the
gravity of their situation.  They were bankrupt.

Alister Compton puzzled over the messages on the screen in front of
him.  He wasn't supposed to be in here, but the presence of a
mysterious computer on the network had first attracted and then
consumed the attension of the young chemist hired to research and
improve the simulation programs being used to develop Burns' new
rocket fuel.  Twenty years old, with matted blond hair, Alister had
left South Africa to study abroad and decided to stay and find a job
after graduating with a double degree in chemisty and physics.
Robotics Research was his first job after college.

He had taken the job because it had challenged him to hone his
knowledge of numerical simulation of quantum mechanical systems well
beyond what he had studied as an undergraduate.  Burns had hired him
not only because his academic background matched what he was looking
for, not only because he had graduated so quickly with a double
degree, but also because the young man had a natural aptitude working
with the computers that were so critical to the project's success.

Yet now that aptitude was begining to land the young South African in
trouble.  He had noticed that Burns or Mercuriou periodically used a
computer that was kept completely isolated from the rest of the
machines on their network.  His inquires about the machine had been
vaguely dismissed.

Yet Alister fancied himself a hacker, and had trained himself to read
keystrokes over people's shoulders.  Burns had carelessly allowed the
young chemist to watch him login to the 'dumper', as the computer was
called, and now Alister had used to password to enter the system
himself and began looking around it.  It contained dozens of files
written in assembly language, which was about as close as you could
get to the machine's underlying architecture without dealing directly
with the bits and bytes.  Alister rarely used assembly, and didn't
bother trying to understand the arcane instructions contained therein.
Instead, he looking at the machine's accounting records, which showed
one program used more than another other on the system.  Alister
ran the program.

A new window appeared on his screen.  On it, brightly colored graphics
portrayed a cue stick deflecting billard balls into a neat square.
Each ball contained a number - sixteen, then thirty-five, then four.
Alister recognized it almost immediately.  It was a Keno game of the
type you might find in a casino.
_What's_all_this_secrecy_about_a_game_, the young man wondered.  Then
the bottom of the screen caught his eye, where the machine displayed
the current date and time.  _What_the_hell!?!_


T - 140 days

Unknown to Alister, Burns also had a completely seperate computer
monitoring the connections to "dumper".  Although the login sessions
were encrypted, they could at least be tracked and logged.  Each
morning, one of Burns' first tasks was to run a program that verified
that the login records matched the packet traces recorded on the
network.  This morning, there was a problem, and Burns sat quietly
staring at the screen as Alister walked into his office.

"What are you looking at?" the young chemist inquired.

A wide grin broke out on Burns' face as he swiveled the screen in
Alister's direction and leaned back in his chair.

"Looked like a bunch of packet traces..." he replied, letting his
voice drift off at the end.

"Did you make any sense out of them?"

"No," the youngster lied.

Burns waved a dismissal, and Alister hastily departed his office.
Later in the day, he noticed that the key he had used to access
'dumper' had disappeared from the system.  In fact, Burns had changed
all the keys, then deleted them off the computers after recording them
on a credit-card sized CD-ROM he began carrying on a chain around his
neck.


T - 137 days

"What did he see?"

Mercuriou asked the question without turning around to face Burns.
Instead, he leaned back in his chair with his back to the engineer
and watched a rain storm pelt the office's plate glass windows.

"He ran the program," Burns replied.

Unbeknownst to Alister, Burns also had a completely seperate computer
monitoring the connections to "dumper".  Although the login sessions
were encrypted, they could at least be tracked and logged.  Each
morning, Burns ran a program that verified that the login records
matched the packet traces recorded on the network.  In addition, the
accounting records were duplicated on the other computer.

"Did he understand what he saw?"

Burns thought for a moment.  The pelting rain was the only sound in
the office.  Mercuriou watched the streaks of water sliding down the
glass.

"Probably.  He's pretty sharp."

"So Alister knows we're up to something; he just doesn't know what,"
Mercuriou concluded, leaning back in his chair and watching a rain
storm pelt the plate glass windows behind his desk.  Burns nodded.
Mercuriou had returned from a visit to "Site Y", and his chief
engineer had just finished filling in his boss on Alister's
unauthorized computer access.

Mercuriou answered first a chuckle, then broke out in an awkward
guffaw.

"You think this is funny?" Burns asked.

"I think it's hilarious.  Our whole operation is made possible by your
super-hack of Chesapeake, and now along comes this twenty-year-old kid
who hacks _your_ network!"

Burns grinned at the thought.

"By the way, did you see this?"

Mercuriou handed Burns a two-day-old copy of a major financial newspaper.
It was folded back to page four, which contained a brief announcement
that the Securities and Exchange Commision had begun an investigation
into the bankruptcy of one Keystone Securities.  Burns read the story
while Mercuriou thought over the problem with Alister.

"This could be serious," the engineer concluded as his returned the
newspaper.

"Oh, it _is_ serious.  They'll eventually catch up with us.  There's a
countdown clock running on this launch, just like with NASA's, T minus
whatever, only we don't know what time it is.  At some point, that
clock goes to zero, and we better be ready to launch when it does."

"It's not going to be today," Burns replied.  "We don't even have all
the engines finished yet, and as you very well know, we don't have
enough ten-thirty-three."

"Well, we better get them finished, we better get all the payload we
need down to Site Y, we better make sure that as soon as we've got
enough ten-thirty-three then we've got a launch capability."

Burns shifted uncomfortably on the couch.  Mercuriou was preaching
the choir, and the engineer didn't like being told what he
very well knew.

"That's all fine," he answered, "but despite offloading the
ten-thirty-three production, we've still got way more work than hands
to do it."

"OK," Mercuriou continued, more thoughfully, "you keep telling me you
need more help, and one of the big things I _haven't_ be able to
provide you is help with all these computer hacks you want done.  Now
can Alister do that for you?"

Burns thought for a moment, begining to follow Mercuriou's line of
thought.  He had known Alister for almost six months (check
chronology) now.

"He's sharp, real sharp.  One of the best technicians I've got, and
yeah, it looks like he can hack, too.  The real question is,
will he hack for us?"

Alister is called into the office.

"Close the door," Mercuriou directed and the young man complied.
Burns began speaking as soon as the door closed.

"There was an unlogged connection to 'dumper' from your workstation
last night at 9:43 PM.  It was encrypted of course, but it looks like
it lasted almost an hour.  Know anything about it?"

Alister's face flushed red.  He had been avoiding Burns all day,
feeling uncomfortable ever since his un-authorized excursion of the
night before.  There seemed little point in trying to deny the
obvious.  Card key records of entry and exit from the building would
place him in the office last night at that time, and his workstation's
own accounting records could probably be mined for evidence to support
the hack.  Anyway, it was curiosity that had driven Alister; he wasn't
a natural liar.

"Yeah, I've seen you type that password a few times and I wanted to
see what was on that machine."

"And what did you see?"

Alister shrugged.  An awkward silence followed.

"OK," Mercuriou cut it, "so you know there's some kind of hack going
on.  You may suspect that this is a front operation of some kind.
What you haven't figured out is the truth, let me assure you.  Sit
down."

Alister planted himself in one of the two vacant chairs in the office.
Mercuriou got up out of his and walked to one of the windows.
He was conscious that the success or failure of his entire plan
hung on his next words and actions.  His mind flashed back
to college, to one of his most energetic professors, writing
"RHETORIC" on the blackbord in bold capital letters.  Turning
around from the window, he faced the young chemist.

"This is a manned mission to Mars," he stated calmly.  "I'm the
commander; Burns is chief engineer."

Alister looked from one man to the other.  Sitting comfortably in the
Mercuriou's office, he couldn't imagine that the man in the swivel
chair was a space captain, or that the pot-smoking hacker reclining on
the coach was a chief engineer.

"Yeah, right," he replied as he got up out of his chair and started
for the door.  "And I'm Mother Theresa."

"This is no joke," Burns informed him.  Alister stopped halfway across
the room.  Both of the other men appeared absolutely serious.

"What I saw on that computer last night wasn't the space shuttle."

"You saw the Kansas state daily lottery drawing," Mercuriou stated in
a tone of voice Burns might have used to declare that gravity
manifested itself as curvature in a four-dimensional space
invarient under Lorentz transformations.

"Of course, you could have turned on the TV and saw the Kansas state
daily lottery drawing," Mercuriou continued, walking forward and
consciously dominating the space of the room, without approaching
close enough to impede on Alister's space.  "Except that you saw
_today's_ Kansas state daily lottery drawing."

Alister looked from one man to the other.

"So, what, you've hacked a state lottery to pay for a Mars mission?"

"Not even close," Mercuriou answered.  "We could hack every state
lottery out there and might barely have the money to put a
communications satellite in orbit."

"What we need," Burns continued, "is this new fuel to work.  Flying to
Mars is a non-starter if we can't do that."

"So what do you need to hack the lottery for?"

Mercuriou waved his arm in a sweeping gesture that including the
desk, the chairs, the office, the computers.  The truth slowly
started to dawn on Alister.

"So all this is stolen? I mean hacked?"

"Stolen," Mercuriou answered.  "That's the right word.  All of it.
Every penny."

Again only the rain could be heard.  Alister turned slowly back
towards his chair.

"We could have moved to Arruba and spent the next ten years sipping
pia coladas on the beach," Mercuriou continued.  "We could have
bought a restaurant, used it to launder the money, and then sat back
and let someone else run it.  We could have checked out this great
society here and done whatever the hell we pleased."

Alister had made it back to his chair and sat down.

"Instead, we decided to do something I've always wanted to do, and
something that this man is uniquely qualified for," Mercuriou waved to
indicate Burns, then continued.  "We decided to see if we can't really
move this space technology forward, come up with a spacecraft fuel
that really works, that will really let people do what Robert Heinlein
just dreamed about, quit piddling around in Low Earth Orbit, and
_fly_to_Mars_.  That's what's we're about.  And that lottery you saw
last night is just the tip of the iceberg, trust me, you have
_no_idea_ how big this hack is.  So the question now is, are you in or
are you out?"


T - 131 days

An entire side of the two story warehouse was taken up by large
stainless steel tanks, interconnected with various machines by a
complex system of plumbing that ran across the ceiling.  Various
blueprints, rulers and small engine components were spread across a
series of tables arranged haphazardly throughout the room.  A
discarded rocket engine, with a large crack down one side, lay propped
against the far wall.  About five latinos, busy working on one piece
of equipment or another, ignored the two Caucasians as they entered.

"This is where we're building the rocket engines," Burns explained.
"The entire nozzle and combustion chamber is fabricated as one
monolithic piece, and a lot of the plumbing, too.  First, we cut
cross-sectional patterns out of ceramic fiber and stack them up to
form the engine shape."

He led the South African to one of the large tables as he spoke.  On
it were bits and pieces of a black fabric that looked like course wool.
Next to the table was an automated cutting machine controlled from a
computer on the table.  A large roll of the fabric lay on the other
side of the machine, and one the workers was supervising it as it ran.

The cutting was done by an industrial laser in a moving mount about
two feet above the table, its beam pointed straight down at the sheet
of fabric laid flat on the table beneath.  The laser moved left and
right on a thin horizontal beam that moved forward and backwards, all
under computer control.  The net result was that by positioning the
horizontal beam with one servo motor, and positioning the laser along
the beam with another, the computer could aim the laser at any point
on the table below.

"Don't stick your hand in there!"  Burns joked.

The laser was cutting a piece of fabric as they approached, and the
smell of burning fiber wafted up into the air as a thin but steady
stream of smoke rose up from where the pencil-thin red light touched
the black fabric.  The laser moved slowly around the pattern, cutting
a thin line through the fabric as it went, its position indicated by a
red dot on the computer screen on the table to its left, which showed
a graphic animation of the pattern being cut.  The cuts were a
concentric series of near-circular gray lines, and the areas between
the lines were colored yellow and green on the display.  As they
watched, the computer completed cutting one of the lines.  The laser
shut off briefly as it repositioned to the next line, then turned on
and began cutting again.

"The yellow areas are discards," Burns explained, kicking at a pile of
scrap fabric underneath the table for emphasis.  "Each of the green
areas is a thin cross-section of the rocket engine.  There's 231 of
them in total.  They get stacked up in order in this graphite mold."

He walked past the laser cutter and showed Alister a large, solid
black casing covered with soot.  Rectangular on the outside, it opened
in two halfs to show the outline of a rocket engine cut out within.

"After a complete set of fabric cross-sections are in the mold, we
close it, compress it down, and put it in the kiln."

The kiln was a shiny steel tank that reached nearly to the roof
of the building.  Much of the facility's plumbing came into it.
An entire side of the tank swiveled open to reveal electric
heating coils, as well as various valves and gauges.

"We turn on the kiln and start pumping hydrogen and MTS gas into its
bottom."

"MTS?" Alister asked, unfamiliar with the acronym.

"Methyl trichlorosilane.  It's stable at room temperature, but starts
reacting with hydrogen at about a thousand degrees Celsius.  Decomposes
into silicon carbide and hydrogen chloride.  The silicon carbide is
deposited as a solid into the gaps between the carbon fibers; that's
why we use such a course fabric.  It's the silicon carbide we're
really interested in; it's stable until almost 3000 degrees Celsius,
and that makes it ideal for rocket construction.  Once the entire
fabric has been filled in with silicon carbide, we shut down the
kiln, crack open the mold, and take out our new rocket engine!"

They walked towards the rear entrance of the building, where a pile of
black ceramic pieces lay against one wall.  Burns picked up one of
them and handed it to his student.

"That's what it looks like when it's done.  If you look closely,
you can just barely see where the fabric was layered, but it's
really hard to tell."

Alister took the piece in his hand.  It was heavy and dense, smooth
and curved on its front and back surfaces, with ragged, sharp edges
around the sides.  Several larger pieces in the pile were clearly
broken parts of a rocket engine, and Alister concluded that the entire
pile had once been an engine as he tossed the piece back.

"What happened to that one?" he asked.

"It blew up when we test-fired it," Burns replied.  He continued his
explaination as Alister looked at him sharply.  "The Mexicans didn't
do a good enough job of aligning the fabric pieces.  They learned the
hard way."

They walked out the back of the building onto the flat dirt mesa.
Burns continued straight ahead, towards a black rocket engine mounted
horizontally and aimed away from the complex, across the empty expanse
of scrub brush.

"This is the firing stand.  We test each rocket after it's finished.
We just fired this one this morning."

They walked around the rocket.  Laid on its side, it was about equal
in height to the two men.  Alister peered into its business end and
was surprised to see what appeared to be fan blades mounted on a shaft
that extended out into the nozzle from the combustion chamber.  The
blades, along with the shaft, were made from the same black ceramic
material as the rocket itself.

"I've seen these fan blades on jets, but I didn't know rocket engines
had them," he noted.

"As far as I know, this is the only rocket design that does.  See,
one of the problems with liquid-fueled rocket engines is that you need
to inject the fuel under pressure.  That implies a pump of some kind,
and the rocket exhaust is the obvious thing to power it with.  Most
liquid-fuel designs syphon off some of the exhaust into turbo pumps on
the side of the rocket.  I played around with that, but it was a huge
pain.  So I decided to just stick a simple turbine in the nozzle and
drive the pumps with that shaft."

"So you, like, designed a whole new engine yourself?"

"Pretty much."

"Why didn't you just use an existing design; wouldn't that have been
simpler?"

"Well, yes and no.  A lot of this stuff is new, like the ceramics, for
example.  When they designed the space shuttle engines back in the
70s, they didn't have silicon carbide, at least not like this.  That's
one of the reasons they didn't put turbine blades right in the exhaust
stream - the materials couldn't handle the heat."

"So what did they use for materials?"

"A lot of the early rocket designs used copper, beleive it or not."

"Copper?  Wouldn't it just melt?"

"It does if you don't cool it.  They used copper because it conducts
heat so well.  So then you have to surround your engine with cooling
pipes and pump either water or liquid oxygen or something through 'em
fast enough to keep the metal walls cool enough so they don't melt."

"No shit?"

"No shit.  And then there was the turbo pump design - they used metal
blades, and _they_ had to be cooled, so you ended up putting little
holes through middle of the blades so you could run cooling fluid
through the turbine fan...  It gets to be a real pain."

They were now walking back towards the building complex.  Alister was
feeling a bit overwealmed, but Burns kept talking about rocket engine
design, continuing on about how he had used an array of 256 computers
to simulate the heat transfer properties of the engine in order to
design its mounting arrangement.  Apparently the silicon carbide could
get quite hot.  The young South African had basically tuned out of the
conversation, but realized at that moment that the pot-smoking
American was absolutely the most brilliant engineer he had ever met.

Alister gets set up with everything he needs to hack.

Burns suggested a 747 for a manned launch vehicle, and Mercurio had
adquired one on lease from a company that specialized in mothballing
jumbo jets that the air carriers didn't want anymore, and that would
eventually be driven into bankruptcy.  The leasing company let the
airplane go for a fraction of its value, partly because it was insured
against air disasters and partially because of expected ease of
recoving the airplane in case of a default.  They would eventually go
bankrupt, partially because of their unexpected inability to recover
the aircraft once it had been launched into orbit.

Burns started by dropping the aircraft's engines out of its nacelles
and replacing them with rockets.  He had carefully designed the rocket
engines so that four of them could lift a 747 into orbit, while a solo
engine could lift a significant mass in an unmanned cargo module.
Next, he converted the entire main body of the aircraft to hold fuel
and oxydizer, leaving just the bubble on top the plane pressurized for
the crew.  At the rear of the bubble he fashioned a fairly spacious
airlock, opening directly upward.  On top the airlock hatch he placed
a hydraulic mating adapter, and another one right on the nose of the
aircraft, both patterned after a NASA design for the space shuttle and
International Space Station.

He reworked the plane's plumbing system, too, adding a dozen piping
connectors to the docking ports, along with electrical connectors.
Each of the cargo modules was similarly equiped with pipes that
connected all of the connectors on one side with the connectors on the
other.  Two of the pipes were used for hydraulic control, one being
pressurized with hydraulic fluid that was shunted to various hydraulic
controls by a collection of control values, another used as a vacuum
line used to draw back used hydraulic fluid.  Another pipe was for
water, and two more were assigned for N-1033 fuel and the hydrogen
peroxide oxidizer.  The remaining half dozen pipes were there as
backups, and more control values allowed any of the backup pipes to be
shunted over to any of the primary pipes, as well as allowing any or
all of the pipes to be closed off.  In the cargo modules, the control
values were all clustered at the forward end of the module, where the
control computer was, allowing for short interconnects.

Burns had also prepared a number of docking nexuses to which up to
six cargo modules could be mated, one in each of the six spatial
directions.  Since the mating adaptors were sexed, requiring a
hydraulicly powered male to attach to a passive female, Burns
designed each docking nexus with three of each sex.

Some of the cargo modules were simply tanks designed to hold either
fuel, or oxidizer, or water.  They were designed so that the plumbing
line for whatever they were carrying went through the tank; all the
other plumbing lines passed straight through from the docking port on
one end to the docking port on the other.  All of these tanks were
equiped with thermostats and heaters, driven by fuel cells, to keep
their contents liquid in the cold of outer space.

Meanwhile, Burns had devised a scheme to spray a insulation
compound derived from carbon that stuck to all the asteroids
they tested it on, and left a layer of insulation that withstood
high temperatures.  He devised a way to spray and insulate
the bottom of the 747.

---- They make it first to the astroid belt, where they outfit the
ship with everything missing.  They build a giant carbon sprayer
and in this way fix the two modules that still have meteor strikes
that can't be sealed.  They sprayed the bottom of an old 747
NASA had given them and began to wonder it to would work as a
landing craft.

"I'm inclined to say the thing looks like a front operation, but that
doesn't make any sense, either."

Dr. Andrea Yeats, electrical engineer, one-time space shuttle
astronaut and now private consultant, continued to read the sheaf of
papers in front her after making this remark.  She was seated in the
office of her long-time friend Lou Becker, once space shuttle program
manager and now director of a special project to convert an unmanned Delta
rocket to use N-1033.  To one side of the office, floor-to-ceiling
windows looked out on NASA's Johnson Spaceflight Center on the
outskirts of Houston, Texas.  Inside, Yeats continued to read.

"There's no question that this stuff works."

"Absolutely none," Becker answered.  "We've tested ten-thirty-three
extensively; it's everything it's cracked up to be.  That's what
doesn't make sense about it.  I've had the same thought as you, that
it's a front operation, but they're not trying to sell us the Brooklyn
Bridge, because we've actually got the goods in hand, heck, we've
still got about a hundred liters of the stuff over in Building 17."

Yeats continued to read.  Becker paused, then went on, ruminating
aloud.

"They're not trying to get any money out of us, either.  They've got
the contract, and we've paid them a little, they seem to be
manufacturing massive quantities of ten-thirty-three, but we just
haven't seen any of it.  I've thought they might be selling it
overseas, but I can't figure why or how.  They evade all of our
inquiries.  They always claim to be having production problems, and
that they need more time."

"Production problems," Andrea echoed, continuing to look at the
papers.  "No way.  Not with the quantities of nitroglycerine they're
consuming.  They've already been shipped enough to fuel three
conventional shuttle launches."

Becker nodded in assent and admiration.  He knew this as well, but
only because he had first computed the energy released by a kilogram
of nitroglycerine and compared that to the energy consumed by a
shuttle launch.  Yeats had performed the same estimate in her head.
Lou had called her in for a reason.

"Andrea, if you think you can glean anything from those papers, be my
guest.  If you want to see ten-thirty-three in action, go see Wilcox
over in 17, you can fire up a rocket in a test chamber.  But bottom
line, I think somebody's got to go out there, see their production
facility, talk to these people, figure out what the heck's going on."

The engineer was shaking her head.

"I'm not a detective, Lou."

"I don't need a detective, Andrea.  I need someone who understands how
this technology works and isn't going to be put off by a bunch of
techno-babble.  I need you."


T - 2 days

Frozen with fear, Dr. Andrea Yeats stared at the young man in his
early twenties sitting in the passenger seat near to her.  His jeans
were ripped, his hair unkempt, and his body excuded a faint odor that
betrayed the three days that had passed since his last shower.  His
heavy blond hair and muscular upper body betrayed months of surfing on
the Southern California beaches.  His eyes had narrowed to slits, and
his lewd smile told that the money in her purse wasn't the only thing
he'd be taking.


T - 1 day

Andrea started hitchhiking herself just after dawn.  She had briefly
considered going to the police, then thought better of it, reasoning
that you forgive your enemies, and that included rapists.  The
cars sped past her on the Interstate highway as she waved her
thumb by her side.  After all the rides she had given out,
wasn't somebody going to stop for her?

Finally, after almost half an hour of waiting, an elderly lady pulled
her aging Volvo onto the shoulder.  Andrea ran up to the passenger
door and climbed in.  The car was old but comfortable, with an Indian
dream catcher hanging from the rear view mirror, a feathered arrow
sitting on the dashboard, and an eccentric collection of cassette
tapes in a compartment just under the ashtray.  Elsie, her driver, was
half-Indian herself and returning home from a visit to her daughter in
Albuquerque.  Andrea rode with her from almost an hour, enjoying a
tape of Caribbean island music while chatting amicably, thinking
little and saying nothing about her ordeal.  Finally, she got out at
the exit that lead to the Robotics Research facility, thanked her new
friend, who pressed a liter of water into her hands before saying
goodbye, and watched her drive off.

The interchange was in the middle of the high desert, with a rocky
crag looming to one side and a heavily travelled dirt road leading off
to the horizon.  As she remembered from the directions, the site was
another ten miles down this road.  It was just past nine o'clock in
the morning, and even if nobody came along to give her a ride, she
figured that she had water and could walk the distance by noon.

Nobody came along.  Even though the road was heavily rutted,
not a single vehicle passed along it in either direction.  Andrea
was grateful for the solitude, and as she treked down the road
at a steady pace, she went over the events of the last twenty
hours in her head and started to weep openly.  As the tears
rolled down her face, she turned her face skyward and
implored God,  "Why have you done this me?"

No answer came back from the heavens, only the midmorning sun blazing
down from a cloudless sky.  The silence encouraged her to speak loadly
and openly to the diety, something she rarely did in the crowded city.

"Did I fail you in some way?"

"Wasn't I supposed to be blessed?  Weren't you going to take
care of us like the birds in the field?"

"Is this some kind of test?"

Finally, emotionally exhausted, she fell down on her knees in the
middle of the roadway and cried steadily for several minutes.
Sitting cross-legged, she drank the rest of her water and took
stock of her situation.  _This_is_stupid_, she thought.
_No_dumb_fuel_problem_is_worth_this_.  _Maybe_I_should_tell_the_
_police_.  _What_if_he_rapes_someone_else_?

Again she looked skyward and prayed to God.

"I'm trying real hard to forgive that man, but what if I can
stop another rape?  I don't know what to do..."

After another boat of tears, she decided to head back to the town,
another exit further on the Interstate, and report the whole thing to
the police.  _I_can't_let_that_son_of_a_bitch_violate_someone_else_ A
sense of peace and calm overcame her, and she sat quietly for a while
longer.  Before she made herself get up and move, though, a dust cloud
appeared where the road met the horizon and grew steadily larger until
a Jeep appeared at its center, drove up to where she was sitting and
rolled to a stop as she got to her feet.

Two men were seated in the Jeep, both dressed for the desert summer in
shorts, T-shirts, and sunglasses.  The man in the passenger seat was
talking on a cellphone and completely ignored her.  The driver, a
friendly fellow in his early twenties, asked her if she needed help,
and she mumbled something about her car being stolen and that she was
heading to the police station in town.  He offered her a ride, and she
climbed into the back seat as he started driving again.  The driver
spoke with a distinct foreign accent that she couldn't quite place.
Australian, perhaps?  He started talking to her, but the passenger
waved him quiet, as he was obviously having problems hearing the
phone conversation over the engine noise, and Andrea lapsed into
silence as they continued towards the Interstate.

"Look, there's just been a delay, that's all," the passenger
told his listener, then fell silent for a moment.

"No, no, there's no problem, it's just a production shortfall.  We
haven't been able to produce the fuel in the quantities we had hoped
for."

Andrea now began to listen intently to the half of the conversation
she could hear.

"Of course it works!  You have the samples don't you?"

"Well, there's a lot more to a production run than cranking out
samples in a laboratory.  A factory..."

"No, no, we've got it licked, we just need more time."

"Look, you want NASA to find out we're selling you anything?"

"OK, then just let me handle it."

"I know how my own government works."

"Thanks."

"Goodbye."

The passenger clicked the cellphone off, then punched some more
buttons on it.  Meanwhile, Andrea slowly digested what she had heard
and began to wonder about who her benefactors were.

"Burns called," the passenger said more to himself than anyone else as
he looked at the phone's display and pushed some more buttons, finally
connecting another call.

"Yeah, what's up?"

"Well, if he doesn't show, he doesn't show."

"A woman?"

Without disconnecting or even lowering the cell phone, he slowly
turned around in his seat, looking at the hitchhiker fixedly as if
seeing her now for the first time.

"I'm sorry," he said, addressing her now for the first time, "we
weren't really introduced..."

Andrea fumbled in her pocket and first thing that came to her
hand was her government I.D.  She pulled it out and thrust it
towards him.

"Andrea Yeats, National Aeronautics and Space Administration."

At various times, Andrea had seen people red-faced with excitement,
hysteria, and embarrassment, but now, for the first time in her life,
she actually watched someone's face as it turned red.  The flush began
just under Mercuriou's cheekbones, then spread across the rest of his
face in a split second.  He clenched his teath and turned back around
in his chair.

"I'll get back to you," he told Burns in a clipped voice, then severed
the connection without waiting for an answer, took the earpiece out of
his ear, wound its cord around the telephone and put in down on the
dashboard.  For a moment they drove on in silence.

"Turn around," Marc quietly told Alister.

"Look, I'm heading into town, I can just walk back..."

"You're not going anywhere," Mercuriou interrupted her, unclipping his
seatbelt, turned fully around in his chair, and reaching back to put
one hand on the seatback near the NASA engineer's shoulder.

Alister brought the Jeep to a stop, then looked back with a pained
expression on his face.

"Turn around," Marc repeated, "Go back home."

Within sight of the Interstate, the South African executed a
three-point turn on the broad roadway and headed back the way they had
come.  Past the rocky crag, past where Andrea had broken down while
praying to God, all the way in silence, all the way back to a locked
gate that Alister stopped long enough to get out, open, then drive
through and pause to lock again behind him.  Almost another mile
further on, he pulled into a complex of buildings and parked in front
of one.  All three got out of the car and walked in.  Andrea followed
the other two, partly out of curiosity, partly because there was
simply no place else to go.  She hadn't seen another vehicle until
they were in the parking lot, and even there were only three other
cars besides the Jeep.

They walked into a large room whose walls were lined with computers on
tables and whose center was a jumble of boxes and packing material.
Vic was packing one of the boxes, and Burns looked up from a computer
as they came in.

"The man who called from NASA was named Vince Becker.  Apparently this
engineer, Dr. Yeats, had a reservation at the Hampton Inns in town,
but the hotel says she never checked in, and..."

His voice drifted off as Andrea entered the room behind the other two.
Vic stopped what he was doing and looked up.  An awkward pause
ensued.

"Doctor Yeats," Mercuriou began slowly, pausing and measuring his 
words, "during the ride here... I was trying to decide... exactly..."

"What you're going to do with me?" she speculatively completed his
sentance.

"Precisely."

"What's going on?  What happened?" Vic asked, the second question
addressed to Alister as if expecting an explanation from him.

The young man opened his mouth as if to speak, but couldn't quite
explain how he had picked up a hitchhiker, or how Mercuriou had
continued his imprudent cellphone conversation, or how they discovered the
true identity of their passenger.  Finally, after a second or two, he
just shrugged and closed his mouth without saying a word.

Andrea broke the silence.

"I beleive the common expression is that I 'know too much'."

"Um-hum," Marc responded and nodded in agreement before turning
towards Burns.

"The old server room, with all the boxes in it, can you rig the door
so it can't be opened from the inside without a card key?"

The engineer leaned back in his chair and nodded slowly.

"Yeah, the locking mechanism is in the wall, so I could weld the
door handle in place, along with the bolt.  You couldn't open it
at all from the inside..."

"Fine.  Do it.  Vic, you and Alister move all the boxes out of there."

The other three men looked slowly at one another.  None of them liked
what they were being asked to do, but Burns got up and lead the other
two from the room, leaving Andrea and Marc to eye each other in
silence, she sitting on a chair in the middle of the room, he perched
on a tabletop.  Ten minutes later, the South African returned to
announce that the room was ready.  Mercuriou escorted the NASA
engineer down a hallway and around a corner to twenty-by-thirty foot
room.  Entering, Andrea turned back to face him.

"Isn't this where I get some fancy explanation of what you're up to?"

"No," he answered, then closed the door behind him, insured that
it was locked, and walked away.

... description of Andrea's cell and her reaction ...

Back in the main room, a spirited discussion now ensued over the
events of the morning.  Alister was reluctant to be party to
a kidnapping and imprisonment, while Vic wryly noted that
Dr. Yeats could seriously jeopardize their plans.

"Nothing's going to happen to her," Marc assured Alister.  "We've just
got to figure out how to stall things for what... another three
weeks?"

"Yeah, just about that," Burns agreed.  "Maybe a month.  If there's no
hitches, two or three weeks."

"OK, OK," Marc concluded, raising a hand to silence any more
objections.  "Look, let me just call this guy Becker back.  There's
nothing unusual in inquiring about someone who was supposed to visit
here anyway."

Marc telephoned the NASA supervisor and after informing him that
Dr. Yeats hadn't shown up yet for her visit, spoke to him for several
minutes.  After hanging up the phone, Marc turned back to face the
other three man, who had been watching and listening silently during
the entire conversation.

"We're fine.  The police found her car abandoned seventy miles from
Denver."  Vic raised an eyebrow.  Denver was several hundred miles
away.

"Car?"  Alister asked.  "What car?  She didn't have a car.  Wait,
she said something about her car being stolen."

"I don't know," Marc answered.  "The police suspect foul play, but
they don't think she's anywhere around here.  They're searching the
Denver area, and think she might have been abducted along the
Interstate somewhere."

"There shouldn't be a problem," he summarized.  "We've got plenty of
food for her; she obviously isn't hurt.  We'll just keep her here for a
few weeks until we can get the launch off, then let her go."

"I still don't like it," Alister said.  "We've basically kidnapped her."

"I don't like it either," Marc admitted.  "Does anybody have any
alternate suggestions?"  There were none.

Later that evening, with nothing else to do, Andrea turned off the
light in the small room and laid down to sleep.

ANDREA'S PRAYER


Launch Day

Andrea woke early in the darkened room and lay still until she heard
voices down the hallway.  During her contemplation, she resolved upon
a plan, which consisted in little more than trying to extract any
possible concession from her jailers which would allow her to get to a
phone and call Lou.  Siting up against the wall, she waited quietly
until the electronic lock clicked and the door was cautiously pushed
open.  It was the blond-haired youth with the foreign accent.  He
turned on the light.

"Good morning.  I brought you some breakfast," he said as cheerily as
he could muster. He put a bottle of water and a military ration down
on the floor next to the door.

"Do you think I could use the bathroom?" Andrea asked, standing up and
pushing her hair back.

"Uh... sure, it's right down the hall," he answered, before leading the
way about a hundred feet to a ladies' room.

"I'll wait here," he mumbled, looking down at his shoes while she
entered the door.

Getting to the restroom was something she had contemplated earlier,
and she knew exactly what she wanted to do.  First, she turned on the
water facuet, and immediately started searching for a way out.  The
room had no windows, which she quickly ascertained, but was covered
with a ceiling of drop panels.  Climbing onto the sink table, she
could reach the ceiling and push one of the ceiling panels aside.  The
wall continued straight up to another ceiling several feet above the
panels.

"Damn," she muttered to herself, then climbed down and went
immediately to the other side of the room.  Entering a stall, she
climbed on the back of a toilet and pushed another panel aside.  On
this side, the wall ended just above the drop panels and offered an
escape route into the adjacent room.  Andrea grabbed the top of the
bathroom stall and clamored up to the ceiling.  She grabbed hold of a
large, circular pipe above the panel ceiling and climbed up above the
ceiling and onto the top of the wall.

She found herself crouched in a dark, dusty space that extended about
four feet above the top of the wall.  Plumbing pipes, electrical
conduits, and some large air ducts crisscrossed the concrete ceiling,
some bolted to it, many of the smaller ones, including the one she had
pulled herself up with, suspended from wires.  In the dim light, she
could make out the course of the wall she was standing on down to
where it met the hallway.  She could easily have inched down the top
of the wall and jumped through the drop ceiling into the hallway where
Alister was waiting for her.  Instead, she laid down on the wall,
reached over to the other side, and pulled aside one of the ceiling
panels in the adjourning room.

In the sunlit room directly beneath her was a chair siting behind a
desk covered with books and papers.  She held on to the same pipe she
had used to pull herself up, swung her legs over the opening in the
ceiling, and dropped down.  The wires supporting the pipe broke loose
under her weight, and the pipe dropped down onto the wall and ceiling
with a crash.  Andrea hung on amid a cloud of dust and debris that
fell on her from above.  Dangling three feet over the floor, she
kicked the chair aside and dropped down onto the carpet.  Outside,
there were voices in the hallway.

Andrea picked up the telephone handset on the desk, then stopped to
look at the contents of the desk.  Amid reference books on celestrial
mechanics, materials science and rocket propulsion were a set of
blueprints for a rocket engine.  Looking just at the cover page, she
knew it wasn't either an American or a European design.  The turbo
pump design was completely novel, and all the text was in both English
and Spanish.  _Spain_never_designed_a_rocket_engine_, she thought, as
she absent-mindedly replaced the handset, now totally engrossed in the
papers before her.  She began flipping through the other papers on the
desk, quickly finding one in particular that caught her interest.  It
read as follows:

   "The Engine Handbook"


Simple liquid fueled rocket - 275 sec spec impulse
  for 59,000 lb thrust  59,000/275 = 214 lb/sec (total propellant flow rate)
  for four engines ~ 1000 lb/sec
  1000 lbs water ~ 120 gallons ~ 500 liters
  433 seconds operating time (216,840 L)
  6,025 cu ft = 45,000 gallons = 180,000 L
  216,840 + 180,000 L ~= 400,000 L
  400,000 L = 800 sec operating time = 13 min


Her mouth went dry as she recognized a number of space shuttle
parameters, including the composition of the solid fuel boosters and
the basic engine thrust budget.  Lou had thought they might be selling
fuel illegally, but that didn't fit.  She thought back to the
conversation she'd overheard yesterday.  _They_aren't_selling_fuel;
_they're_hoarding_it.  And now the rocket design and the launch
budget...  Her contemplation was cut short by Mercuriou's loud voice
from the hallway.

"Coming in, doctor, pull up your pants!"

Broken from her reverie, Andrea snatched up the telephone once more,
punched nine and got a second dial tone.  Looking out the window, she
could see that the sun had been up several hours.  Additionally,
Houston was an hour ahead of them, so she hoped Lou was already at
work, or had at least turned on his cell phone.  She heard noises in
the room behind her as she dialed the number.  He answered on the
second ring.

"Lou, it's Andrea!"

"My God, girl, where are you?  The police are looking all over the
Rockies for you!"

"I'm at NuTech; they're holding me prisoner here."

"What?!"  Her boss was incredulous.  "But they found your car near
Denver!"

"Look, that's not important now..." she began as the door's electronic
lock clicked open and Mercuriou dashed in.

"They're planning a launch!" she yelled as the irate captain sprinted
across the room and slammed his hand down on the telephone to sever
the connection.

"What are you up to?" she asked him, but instead of answering,
Mercurio took her by the arm and half led, half dragged her back down
the hall to her improvised cell, put her back inside, then closed and
locked the door behind her without saying another word.

The phone was ringing as he returned to the control room.  It was
Becker, and he demanded to speak to Andrea Yeats.  After first
disclaiming any knowledge of her, Mercuriou finally just hung
up the phone.  His crew was gathered around, silent.

"His caller I.D. showed that the call came from here.  He said
he was calling the police."

"So what do we do now?" Alister asked.

"Well, we go on.  Burns, what happens if we launch?"

"When?"

"Well, just for argument's sake, right now."

The engineer made a pained expression with his face and thought for a
minute.

"Well, it all depends on our launch vehicles.  Certainly the 747 is
ready to go, it just needs to be fueled and a few more supplies put on
board.  The real question is the cargo rockets.  We've designed a lot
of redundancy into their payloads in case there are launch failures.
If we launch with what we've got now, we lose a lot of that
redundancy.  If all the cargo modules make it to orbit, we're O.K, but
there's a lot less room for error.  Also, we'll be short on fuel.
We've planned the launch schedule around our producation capacity for
N-1033, and we'll come up short.  I doubt we'll be able to land on
Mars, at least not with the fuel we've got."

The room lapsed back into silence while the captain thought.  Finally,
he addressed the rest of the crew.

"Can anybody think of anything we need to have, putting aside
redundancy, anything we absolutely need for this mission that we've
haven't got loaded yet?"

Nobody said anything for a minute.  Finally, Vic spoke up.

"Well, we've got checklists, right?"

"Sure," Burns replied, and turned back to his computer terminal to
begin pulling up the lists.  Each of the crewmen now went through the
checklists they had prepared for their specific specialties.  Vic
checked again the list of medical and horticultural supplies.  Alister
and Burns went through the engineering and scientific payloads.
Mercuriou checked the food, water, gas and fuel manifests.

By the time there were done, an alarm went off indicating that the
front gate was being opened, and Alister pulled up a video feed on his
computer terminal that showed three police cars at the gate and
several policemen who had just cut the chain off the gate.

"Blow the bridge," Mercuriou said calmly.  Alister keyed a radio
controlled detonator and in the distance they could hear the sound of
explosives destroying a bridge over a ravine between them and the
police.

"That won't stop them for long," Vic mused.

"No," Mercuriou agreed, then turned to Burns.  "OK, it's launch day."



----

"What should we do with the NASA engineer?" Bryan asked.

Mercurio thought for a moment.  The supply rockets were launching
every five minutes and the 747 was completely fueled.  Burns
was getting ready to switch the supply rockets' launch sequences
to automatic, from which point there would be no way to stop
them from the ground.

"We can let her go now, I think," the Captain concluded.  He walked
with Bryan to the locked supply closet where Andrea Yeats had been
held for the last three days, and opened the door.  She had heard
them coming and was standing by the wall, waiting for them.

"Well, Doctor, you can go now," Mercurio announced.  "Sorry for
your detention, but it was necessary at the time."

He walked back to the room where Burns was monitoring the
supply rockets.  Yeats followed him at a short distance.

"The launch sequence is on automatic," Burns announced as they entered
the room.

There was very little to pack up.  Everything needed in orbit had already
been loaded into either the supply rockets or the 747.  The control
equipment on Earth, mostly ordinary computers, was all duplicate,
courtesy of the mega-bucks from their mega-hack.


"Look, if you're heading into space, you need an experienced astronaut."

"Doctor, let me assure you, we don't need your help.  NASA aren't the
only people capable of launching a manned mission.  We're more than
capable ourselves."

Andrea paused for a moment and adjusted her approach.  "Fine, you don't
_need_ me.  You can _use_ my help.  You can _use_ an experienced
astronaut, or do you think that someone with two shuttle missions
under her belt would be useless to you?"

Mercurio stopped walking and waved Burns to keep going.  Instead,
the engineer stopped and listened.

"Look, you don't even know what our mission is."

"OK, so, why don't you tell me."

Mercurio started laughing, and put his hand against the wall to brace
himself.  The NASA engineer was dead serious.  Finally, he stopped
laughing and looked back at her.

"We're going to Mars."

Now it was Yeats' turn to grin.

"That's great; I've always wanted to go to Mars!"

The two looked at each other and laughed together.  The situation was
absolutely absurd.

"Look, I don't even have a spacesuit for you."  Burns threw Mercuriou
a surprised look.  He statement wasn't entirely true.

"I don't need one," she shot back.

"Doctor, my policy is that everyone on this mission has a spacesuit."

"So?  I thought NASA's biggest problem was that we're locked in to our
policies and procedures."

Mercurio turned back down the hallway and began walking again.  Yeats
continued to follow as the Captain continued to voice objections.

"We're not coming back here for a long time.  This isn't a decision
to make on the spur of the moment."

Yeats was silent for only moment.  For the first time since Lou Becker
had walked into her garden, it all clicked.  The screwed up
manufacturing budget.  The massive and irregular expenditures.
_They're_trying_a_Mars_launch_.  And for the first time since she
picked up a hitchhiker two days agos, actually wanted to laugh.
_THIS_I_have_GOT_to_see_.  Anyway, if they made it to Mars, she wanted
to be there, and if they didn't, they'd _really_ need her help.

"Let me make my own decisions, Captain.  I want to be part of your
mission."  /  "I can make my own decisions, in my own way, Captain."

Mercurio looked back at her, grimaced and shook his head, but said
nothing.  He walked out the back door and climbed into the driver's
seat of one of the Jeeps parked there, setting his suit's power unit
behind.  Yeats sat in the passenger seat without being invited and
they drove in silence towards the runway and the spaceplane, Mercurio
wondering how to get rid of her, Yeats composing herself by saying a
silent prayer: "Lord, let me put my life here in your hands.  Let this
man make the decision to do your will, and I will accept it.  Let me
put my faith in you to provide for my life and its needs."

Finally, they reached the 747 and climbed onto it from an accessway
built from the ground to the rear of its left wing, then up a ladder
to its roof.  Then they went up another ladder to the airlock hatch on
top of the bubble and entered the spaceplane via the airlock.

"Dr. Yeats wants to come with us," Mercurio announced to the surprised
crew.  They looked at her and each other with an air of bewilderment,
then finally back to the Captain.  Mercurio addressed himself to Burns,
who had turned around in the pilot's seat and was looking back
into the cabin.

"Any technical reasons she can't go?"

The engineer though for several minutes.  Their year's supply of food
would be cut down to about eight months with her addition, but the
rations wouldn't be enough to sustain them in any event.  It would
just give them less of a margin for error for getting the greenhouses
working.  The weight wasn't an issue on the 747, since almost
everything was loaded into the cargo modules, another one of which
launched as the Captain waited for an answer.  The roar of the rocket
(launching) less than five miles away briefly drown out any
conversation.  Alister, who had turned back to the engineer's station
in the rear of the cockpit, broke the silence by announcing that
the launch sequence was going as planned.

"Well?" Mercurio prompted Burns.

"I guess not; I can't think of any reason why not; not any technical
reasons, that is."

Mercurio turned back to the NASA engineer, standing behind him.  He
opened his mouth, trying to tell her to get lost, but just closed it
again after no words came out.  On the one hand, he was reluctant to
make such a momentous decision so suddenly.  On the other hand, he
knew / his gut told him that if they could work together, an
experienced astronaut would be an invaluable addition to the crew.
Perhaps his gut also told him something about this remarkable woman.
Finally, in a completely uncharacteristic moment of aquiesance, he
just waved his hand nonchalantly.

"Fine, you can go."

Vic got out of his chair and began taking off his spacesuit as
Mercurio climbed back out of the airlock to throw the ladders
down to the ground.  Andrea was arguing with Vic as he returned
and closed the airlock behind him.

"Look, you're putting on this spacesuit."

"No, you wear your spacesuit, I'm fine without one."

"I'm the ship's doctor, and I'm giving you a medical order.  You
put on this spacesuit, now."

As Mercurio looked on, Andrea gave up.

"Fine," she said, and began suiting up as Mercurio walked forward
and sat in the 747 captain's chair next to Burns.

"Is this a good idea?" the engineer asked.

"I don't know," the Captain answered.

"Isn't it dangerous for Vic to not be wearing a spacesuit during
launch?" Alister asked.

"Yeah, but if he needs it during launch, we're all in trouble," Burns
replied.

Mercurio shook his head again, as he finished attaching his spacesuit
supply lines to air hoses running to his seat along the floor, put his
helmet on and sealed it.  For some reason, he just couldn't turn down
the assertive but pleasant woman (from NASA).  He turned his attention
to the final pre-launch checklist with Burns and Alister.

"GPS?"

"On... position locked."

"Fuel values?"

"Open."

"Atmospheric seals?"

"Closed."

"OK, everyone ready to go?" the Captain asked, using the question in
lue of a com check.

"We're ready," Burns confirmed, "Alister?"

"I'm ready."

"Ship's doctor ready for takeoff!" Vic jauntily proclaimed from
his seat in the passenger section behind the cockpit.

"Dr. Yeats?" the Captain dramatically inquired, after a moment of silence.

"Ready," the veteran astronaut proclaimed.  She hadn't answered at
once because she had been double-checking the connections on the
(somewhat) unfamiliar Russian spacesuit.

"Let's go!" the Captain proclaimed, and Burns hit the engine start
button on his touchscreen panel.  Far to their rear, electronically
controlled values opened to let N-1033 flow into the rocket engines.
100 milliseconds after opening the values, the engine control computer
fired a spark gap that ignited the fuel.  The engines belched fire
with a roar.

"Start one, two, four... three start... all engines good start!"
Alister declared from the engineer's position behind Burns.  The 747
lurched forward, straining against its brakes, as the police officers
gathered outside backed away from the heat.

Burns released the brakes and the plane shot forward, down the runway
and away from the stunned policemen standing near the abandoned
gentryway.  Quickly it gathered speed.

"100 knots," Alister proclamed.

Mercurio surveyed the brightly colored computer displays in front
of him.  With Burns piloting the plane, he had little to do, but
had made sure he was familiar with all the craft's systems.  The
engines were firing at their minimum force, about half power,
but it was still more thrust than generated by conventional
747 engines, and the crew was pushed back into their seats
by nearly three gees of acceleration.

"150 knots... V-1!" Alister declared.

The plane was now hurtling down the otherwise unused runway on top the
mesa.  They had reached and passed the speed where any takeoff abort
would be possible.  They were commited at least to a liftoff.

"200 knots... V-R!" came Alister's cry.

Burns eased back on the control yoke, one of the few parts of the
original 747 left unmodified, and the giant plane soared upwards
into the sky.  Some of the observers on the ground watched with
their months agap, deafened by the roaring rocket engines and
stunned by the sight of a jumbo jet belching rocket exhaust.

"Gear up," Burns ordered calmly.

"Gear up," the Captain acknowledged, as he pushed the button to raise
the landing gear.  Burns retracted the wing flaps and guided the plane
spaceward.  Unlike any conventional takeoff, he didn't level off at
10,000 feet, or 20,000 feet, or 30,000 feet, nor did the force of
acceleration notably decline until he put the plane into a near
vertical climb.  It wasn't the most optimal launch profile, but the
aircraft wasn't designed for supersonic flight, so Burns made sure he
climbed above most of the atmosphere before beginning a true orbital
insertion.  After about a minute of flight, they passed 100,000 feet.
The conventional control surfaces were becoming unusable due to the
rarified atmosphere.  Burns took his right hand off the control yoke
and placed it on a joystick to his right.

"Release engine gimbles," he instructed.

"Engine gimbles released," Alister acknowledged, after pressing a
button and watching several indicators turn green / change color.

The rocket engines, mounted in hydraulically mobile mountings, now
swiveled at Burns' command.  He nudged forward on the joystick, the
engines pivoted downwards and the aircraft turned towards the
horizontal.  Two minutes into launch, they now passed 200,000 feet.
The sky was completely black.  As the aircraft turned down to about a
thirty percent angle with the horizon, the Earth rose into the view of
the pilots.  It's curvature was obvious.  An entire range of the Rocky
Mountains lay streched out beneath them, abutting the salt flats from
where they had launched.

"Increase to full power," Burns instructed.

"Full power," Alister acknowledged.

The engines, like neglected children throwing an attention tantrum,
doubled their thrust and pushed the crew further back into their
seats.  Bladders in the legs of their spacesuits inflated with air to
push blood upwards in their bodies and ensure they remained conscious,
now with more than five gees of thrust pressing against them.  Andrea
had never experienced a launch quite like this.  Space shuttle
launches were carefully profiled never to expose the crew to more than
three gees of acceleration.  Vic blacked out, the first unexpected
consequence of Andrea's presence.

Burns switched his primary display from the almost useless airplane
indicators to an precomputed orbital injection profile based on
continually updated GPS coordinates.  The display showed the projected
course in blue, from both side and top perspectives, along with the
plane's actual course in red.  The aircraft was slightly below the
profile, so Burns eased back on the joystick to raise the plane's
attitude slightly and guided the red line back towards the blue one.
He didn't believe in autopilots, and hadn't had the time to program
one, anyway.

At fifty miles in altitude, they were now above most of the
atmosphere, and the blue line flattened out.  Burns guided the
spacecraft along it.  Almost all of the engine force was now directed
towards increasing the craft's speed to orbital velocity.  Ten minutes
into launch, the 747 was eighty miles high and the GPS indicator
showed their speed at 10 km/s.  Burns continued firing the engines
until nearly two thirds of the ship's fuel had been exhausted.  He
then cut off the engines and let the ship coast in free-fall for
another half an hour.  Now well over a hundred miles in altitude, the
ship continued to climb.  On the radar display, the pilots could see
the clump of cargo modules they were approaching from below.  Finally,
Burns fired the engines again to stabilize the orbit just as they
reached the cargo modules.  A hundred and twenty miles in altitude,
the ship was in a ninety-minute Low Earth Orbit in the midst of over
hundred free-floating cargo modules.

Once in orbit, the crew got right to work.  They had to.  Most of
their fuel and supplies were in the cargo modules, which were built
around a three-part design.  The first stage boosted the module to
orbital height and speed, though with a perigee still in the
atmosphere.  After detaching the first stage, the second stage fired
briefly at apogee to raise the module to a circular orbit, while the
first stage dropped back into the atmosphere and burned up.  Atop the
second stage was the cargo module itself, equiped with a laptop
computer using a radio communications link and a fuel cell fed
from supply lines of N-1033 and peroxide.

The cargo modules, launched five minutes apart over the course of
several hours, were now spread out all over Low Earth Orbit, while the
747 with the crew onboard was in a six-hour orbit hundreds of miles
above.  This was deliberate.  Since the cargo modules were themselves
hundreds of miles apart, rendezvousing with each of them in LEO would
have required many complex engine burns.  Instead, and considering
that their ultimate goal was Mars, Burns had elected to put the 747
into a higher orbit, then wait for each cargo module to come into a
favorable alignment, fire its rocket engine remotely, and put it in a
transfer orbit that would bring it to them.  This enabled the crew to
bring each cargo module to them, roughly one per hour, over the course
of the next several days.

On Earth, confusion reigned.  CNN, the American 24-hour news network,
had reported the last several launches live, and speculation was
rampant that the missiles contained some kind of chemical or
biological agent.  Around the world, TV networks began interrupting
their regular programming to cover the event, showing graphical ground
tracks of the orbiting cargo modules and warning people as they
drifted above.  The U.S. State Department was fielding a barrage
of queries from foreign embassies anxious to know how serious
the situation was.  The President abandoned a trip to the midwest
and turned Air Force One back towards Washington, D.C.
Somehow, amid all the ballyho, the 747 had been lost
completely and effectively disappeared into high Earth orbit.

Five hours after the 747's launch, Burns fired the rocket engine of
the first cargo module and put it into its transfer orbit.  NORAD
detected the course change and reported it to the Pentagon within
minutes.  By the time the third cargo module had been put into
transfer orbit, it was clear to NORAD that the engine burns were
lifting the modules into higher orbits, not deorbiting them as some
kind of attack.  They computed the rendezvous point and readquired the
747 there, just as it was docking with the first cargo module.

In Washington, the President held a hurried meeting of his national
security team, finally blowing up in frustration at their inability to
provide any concrete answers, throwing a briefing folder across the
room and sending top secret papers flying everywhere.

"What the hell do I have a CIA for if I've got to find out from CNN
when 170 missiles get fired off in Utah?"

That evening, the President addressed a nervous / rapt but unshaken
nation, informing them of basically what their news networks had been
reporting for hours.  Aside from reassuring them that the U.S.
government was carefully tracking the situation, the only new
information he provided was NORAD's assessment that the cargo modules
were being moved to higher orbits and therefore probably weren't part
of an attack.  From his home in Houston, Lou Becker watched the press
conference alone and in silence.  Andrea Yeats was never mentioned.


T + 1 day

Among the many high-ticket items the _Icarus_ crew had purchased with
their stolen millions was a set of satellite telephones.  These were
similar to ordinary cellular telephones, but were designed to operate
in remote regions of the Earth lacking cell phone coverage.  Thus,
instead of using cells ten miles wide and switching the phone calls
from one cell to another as the mobile user moved between them, as an
ordinary cellular system would do, the satellite system used cells two
hundred miles high, based on satellites in low earth orbit, and
switched calls from one satellite to another as they moved through
their orbits in a carefully choreographed pattern.  Burns had studied
the system closely to make sure it would still work if not only the
cells, but the telephone itself was moving in an orbital pattern.

One of the first items on the ship's long on-orbit checklist was to
verify the proper operation of these phones, after which Mercuriou
made the first phone call.  It was to the news bureau of a major
television network.  The captain finally convinced the skeptical
editors that he really was in space by agreeing to a television
interview, then handing the telephone to Burns, who then spent another
hour discussing with the network's technicians how to relay the video
signal.  Since the _Icarus_ was equipped with a microwave antenna
array designed to track moving satellites, and the television network
had no such equipment readily available, they finally agreed to use an
existing television satellite in geostationary orbit as a relay, which
provided about twenty minutes of video capability each time the
_Icarus_ passed around its ninety-minute orbit.  As soon as the
network received the first images of men floating in zero-gee in the
cabin of a heavily modified 747, they knew they had their scoop, and
carried the interview live, conducted by the anchor of their nightly
national news program.  Thus, the world got it's first dose of Captain
Marcelius Mercuriou.

"Captain, I just don't understand.  Your company has developed a major
new rocket fuel; you _did_ legitimately develop N-1033, didn't you?"

"Sure we did.  But where do you think we got the money to develop it?
You think they just give computational chemistry software aware for
free?  You think you get Pyrex laboratory equipment handed to you just
because you want to play around with some crazy idea that might
somehow make the world a better place?  People just put food in front
of your chemists because they get up and go to work in the morning?
No, you need money for all of it!  It cost us over a million dollars
just to _develop_ N-1033; that was before you ever heard of us!"

"So where did you get the money from?"

"I told you, we stole it!"

"But you had a working product.  Couldn't you get all the venture
capital funding you needed?"

"We didn't have a working product at first," Mercuriou noted.  "We had
nothing.  One really smart guy who thought you design a rocket fuel
with a computer.  That's it.  No computers.  No staff.  No software.
No lab.  Nothing.  Now how do you get that venture capital funding?
I'll tell you how.  You sell your soul to the capitalists.  You
convince them, and I mean really sell them, that you're one of them,
that you believe in their nightmare philosophy of greed, you agree to
bring on their management team, you agree to some 'business plan' that
tells how you're going to patent and control this technology once it's
developed, because these people will do nothing unless they can see
how they'll get a big killing back out it, and unless you can really
bring something more than your good ideas to the table, you'll fight
like hell just to keep 51% of the company.  And if you tell them the
truth, that once you invent this thing that their dear precious money
paid for, you're going to publish everything you've got about how it
works, they'll drop you like a hot potato.  Or you toil away in your
garage for ten years of nights and weekends while working some stupid
job just to pay for the garage, and I'm not much of garage guy.  So we
developed, let's just say, an original source of funding."

"And what was that?  Did you rob a bank?"

Mercuriou starting laughing.

"Something like that.  Ever heard of Keystone Securities?"

After Mercuriou's interview was finished, Andrea finally had the
opportunity to use the telephone.  Far from being held as a prisoner
now, she had been given the run of the ship once it was in orbit.  She
called Lou at home.

"My God, girl, where are you?"

"Where do you think I am, Lou?" she answered dryly.  "I'm in space."

T + 1.1 days

"We have to perform an EVA, now," Burns told Andrea as they were
finishing the military rations that would serve as breakfast for many
more days to come.  "Hopefully it's the only one we need to perform in
Earth orbit."

"Why?" the NASA engineer asked, with a trace of concern in her voice.

"We need an OTV.  OK, we don't absolutely need one, but trying to
assemble the cargo modules into a chain with the 747..." Burns let
his voice trail off.  Andrea nodded in assent.

"OK, so you need to EVA to get an OTV?"

"Right.  We've got engines, a lot of them, actually, in cargo modules.
We need to open one of those modules, remove one of the engines, and
attach it to the rear of a fuel module.  All of the modules have
maneuvering jets powered by nitrogen gas, which is a by-product of the
ten-thirty-three fuel cell reaction, along with oxygen and carbon.
But to really push things around in orbit, we need an rocket engine."

"OK, so who's doing it?"

"Alister and I will do it.  We've rehearsed it in a water tank."

"Water tanks are a bit different from zero-gee."

"Well, ours is a lot closer to it than most."

T + 1.2 days

"Captain, thank you for joining us."

"You're quite welcome.  We're running the ship on Universal Time,
so it's a bit later here, but I'm quite happy to participate."

"We saw your crew today perform their first spacewalk, I should say,
the first spacewalk by a private crew.  It went fairly well, did it
not?"

"Yes, it went fine..."

T + 1.5 days

"OK," Vic announced to the assembled crew, holding open the door to
one of the 747's lavatories.

"Those of you who know how this toilet works have never taken a crap
in zero-gee."  Alister blushed at the doctor's frank language, and
Andrea bit her tongue.  "Dr. Yeats, of course, is the only one of us
who's had that experience before, but she's only seen the shuttle's
toilet."

"This is a modification of the shuttle's toilet design," Burns
interjected, "so it shouldn't be too unfamilar to you."

Andrea nodded, and the doctor continued.

"Like the shuttle toilet, it uses air pressure to draw the waste down
into it, so you need to turn on the vacuum pump, here."  Vic indicated
a switch that had been mounted next to the toilet.

"_Unlike_ the shuttle toilet, the waste is not dumped overboard,
because we need to recycle it into fertilizer for the plants.  Put
simply, we can't afford to throw _anything_ overboard.  So before you
turn on the vacuum pump, make sure there's a clean waste jar installed
at the base of the toilet, and the vacuum hose is connected to it."

The clean waste jars, each about four liters in size, made of
transparent glass, and partially filled with an inert filter, were
kept in a cabinet across from the lavatory.  Vic demonstrated the
removal and installation of a jar, as Andrea watched with interest.
This was significantly different from the space shuttle's toilet,
which made no attempt to recycle anything.

"We have no toilet paper, because we can't afford to clog up our
recycling system with a bunch of paper.  Instead, we have a bidot
built into the toilet."

"That's the thing that washes your butt," Alister observed, as Andrea
continued to nod.  Vic continued his lecture.

"You turn on the bidot here, and you get a stream of pressurized water
here," Vic indicated a value next to the toilet and a fixture inside
the toilet, aimed at the seat from below.

"This knob adjusts the direction of the water flow.  Try not to use
too much; we've got plenty of water right now, but it has to last all
the way to Mars and back.  When you're done, turn off the bidot, turn
off the vacuum pump, and seal the waste jar like this."  Vic
showed how to seal and remove the waste jar.

"Then you take this pen," Vic flourished a black marker tied to a
string inside the lav, "record on the jar your name, the date, and the
approximate time, and push it into this receptacle where the used jars
are kept until I come and collect them for recycling."

"Sounds like a fun job," Andrea noted.

"Well, I'm sure I could use some help," the doctor noted gleefully.
"I've certainly never tried to run a sewage system before, let along
try to recycle anything back out of it."

In truth, Andrea was suitably impressed not only by the toilet, but by
the entire operation of the _Icarus_.  For many years, she had
advocated that NASA pay more attention to recycling.  The entire space
mission was somewhat amateurish, but clearly had been carefully
thought through and well planned.  The toilet was far more consistent
with the needs of a deep-space mission that couldn't be resupplied
from earth.

Burns had originally toyed with the idea of putting windows in some of
the cargo modules to let sunlight in for growing plants.  The time
factor had caused him to forego this in favor of solid, uncut cargo
modules and more than two hundred grow lights that he had simply
packed away, surrounded by almost a solid foot of styrofoam packing
peanuts to protect them against the bumpy ride up.  Due in large part
to their inefficient launch profile and consequent low accelerations,
all the lights made it.

Supplying them with power was a different story.  Burns had brought
four fuel cells capable of reacting the kerosene and the oxygen
produced from the hydrogen peroxide, albeit inefficiently, and mounted
two of them in the 747's pressurized upper deck.  They were supplied
with fuel from a pair of tanks in the rear of the 747.  Each tank
contained a diaphragm with pressurized air on one side and liquid fuel
or oxidizer on the other.  Especially in the micro gravity of Earth
orbit, little air pressure was required to keep the fluid flowing to
the fuel cells, and Burns had designed the tanks so he could force
more fuel into them from the plane's main fuel tanks by starting the
rocket engines and using the force of the thrust to force fuel back
into the tanks.  He also had several small tanks of fuel and oxidizer
that fit through the hatchways and could be used in emergencies.

But the real power would have to come from the solar panels.  The ship
just didn't have enough power to operate the grow lights so critical
for the ultimate success of the mission.  Moreover, if they continued
to use the power cells, they would eventually run out of fuel.
They had not brought enough fuel to both get to the astroid belt
and run the fuel cells the entire way.

So, the first week in orbit consisted almost entirely of orbital
operations, as Burns docked with one cargo module after another,
slowing refueling the 747 from the 30,000 L capacity of each module.
Along the way, he also assembled the cargo modules in a long chain
attached to the docking ring on the nose of the 747, which became
like a tugboat pushing a cargo barge around Earth orbit.


T + 3 days

The _Icarus_ began her third full day in orbit amid a jumble of cargo
modules.  More were stacked up in a parking orbit 50 to 200 kilometers
behind the craft, and yet more sat in low Earth orbit, their computers
awaiting radio instructions to boost them into higher orbits.  The
docking procedures were going slowly.  This wasn't entirely
unexpected, but it wasn't exactly welcome, either.  Among other
things, it left the craft vulnerable to meteor strikes, and
there was a lot of debris floating around in low earth orbit.

Andrea Yeats was studying the _Icarus_ with the fervor of an ardent
disciple finally admitted to the priest's high holy sanctum.  Alone
among the crew, she didn't have any assigned duties, and today had
squirreled herself away into the ship's electronics lab, a cargo
module filled with boxed equipment that had been docked the day before
and then left alone.  The boxes she left untouched; her interest was
fixated on a tablet computer connected via the ship's wireless local
network.  After skimming through the thousands of documents related to
the ship's design, all the result of Burns' prodigious mind, she then
found her way into the ship's library.

It was extensive, numbering well over ten thousand books, completely
electronic, and totally illegal.  Every major publisher of technical
books in the English language had been targeted by Burns' super-hack,
and the few books of which Alister couldn't spirit off electronic
copies from the publishers' computers were purchased and shipped to
Site Y, where their bindings were sawed off, the pages were
systematically scanned, and the resulting digital images transmitted
back electronically.  Without lauching more than a few pounds of
books, most of these for nostalgic value, such as Burns' 1956 first
edition of Adrian Albert's _Fundamental_Concepts_of_Higher_Algebra_,
the _Icarus_ crew enjoyed easy access to major reference works on
every aspect of technology.  There was an entire book, for example,
simply titled _Uranium_, that described almost everything known about
the chemistry of that important element - it's dozens of compounds,
their properties, the reactions used to convert between them, and of
course its nuclear properties, despite the fact that _Icarus_ carried
only a small sample of uranium in its chemistry lab and Burns had no
intention of using a nuclear fuel source.  In fact, all the major
chemical elements were well represented, with entire books on silicon,
iron, and nearly a dozen on carbon and its various compounds.  There
were also books on antenna theory, orbital mechanics, and hydroponics,
as well as Mercuriou's hand-picked collection of ancient Greek and
Latin authors, both in translation and in the original tongues.

Almost as impressive was the software collection.  Every major
technical product was present, many including all their source code,
stolen from the manufacturer's computers by Burns and Alister.  The
scientific software was second to none.  In addition to _Gaussian_ and
programs like it, there were sophisticated packages to model and
simulate high-frequency microwave circuitry, the most advanced robotic
control software from Japan, including the factory blueprints and
source code to a complete automobile assembly plant, and the most
sophisticated mathematics systems, which turned the complex algebraic
and trigonometric manipulations of orbital mechanics into a
high-school exercise.  To say Andrea was impressed would be a vast
understatement.  The three-pound computer tablet in her hand offered
the same information that would fill a small, elite university
library.  The legal penalties for acquiring and possessing it added up
to more than eighty years of prison time.

"We've got a pressure drop," Alister announced from the copilot's
seat, as an amber alert window popped up on the computer screen to his
right.  Burns and Mercuriou, both in the rear of the 747, propelled
themselves to the door of the cockpit.

"We're down to 97.4," Alister informed them, reading off the
atmospheric pressure in kilopascals.

"That's not much," Mercuriou observed.

"Yeah, but it should be a closed system," Burns answered.

"97.0," Alister stated.

"Should we go to Zed?" the captain inquired of his engineer.

"I think so."

"OK, everybody, we're going to Condition Zed," Mercuriou called into
the microphone clipped to his shirt.  In the cockpit, Alister selected
a command sequence on his computer as Burns pulled himself into the
pilot's seat.  A audible alarm began to sound throughout the ship, and
the hydraulic doors separating the different modules hissed shut.

"What's happening?" Dr. Yeats asked as she watched the door hizz shut
on the cargo module she was in.  She was at the far end of the module,
full of lab equipment, and didn't have time to reach the door before
it shut.

"Condition Zed, Dr. Yeats, we're closing the airtight doors," Mercuriou
answered through the com system.  "Vic, where are you?"

"I'm in sickbay, of course," the doctor answered, stopping his
inventory of the drug supply.

"Make sure you've got a spacesuit in there," the captain directed.
"Dr. Yeats, where are you?"

"Well, I'm in the D-4 module with the electronics equipment," she
answered.

"Right there," Burns pointed to one of the forward cargo modules on
the display screen.

"Do you have a spacesuit there?" the captain wondered aloud. Burns
shook his head no.

"I don't think so," she answered in a matter-of-fact tone of voice.
"There doesn't seem to be anything in here but oscilloscopes and
silicon wafers."

"I'm OK, I've got my suit here," Vic answered from the sickbay module.

Meanwhile, the news networks on Earth began to realize that
something was happening on the spacecraft.  They began cutting
into their programming with "Breaking News" alerts.

"We're down to 90 in C-4," Alister declared from his computer
terminal.  "Looks like the rest are holding."

"C-4 is right here," Burns informed the captain, indicating a cargo
module directly adjacent to the one Andrea Yeats was in.  "Probably a
meteor strike.  We're not fully assembled yet, so right now C-4 is in
front."

The plan for the spaceship was to put the unpressurized storage
modules in the front, where damage would be minimal from a meteor
strike, but the assembly was only partially complete, and the
pressurized C-4 module, slated for a chemistry lab, was currently in
front - directly in the path of incoming meteors.

"We probably want to get her out of there," the captain said in an
undertone, refering to Yeats' exposed position.

"Yep," Burns agreed, "she's probably OK, but she doesn't have a
spacesuit, and the only way out is through node 4.  We're assuming
that it's a meteor strike, too.  If not, if it's a pressure seal
problem and we lose node 4, then she'll be cut off."

"OK," the captain concurred, keying his microphone, "Dr. Yeats, why
don't you exit the module you're in and come back here to where we've
at least got a spacesuit for you, then we'll check on the problem in
C-4."

"I can open the pressure door from here," Burns added, "or you can
use the control panel in the node to do it."

The NASA engineer drifted to the pressure door and examined its
touchscreen controls.  Sure enough, there was a menu option for the
door.  Although she had seen it before, she had never had reason to
use it.  Meanwhile, Burns selected a control sequence in the bridge
and the door opened automatically.  Andrea pulled herself through it
and into node 4, a small spherical space with about as much interior
space as a small automobile.  Burns opened the door to A-4, which lead
back towards the main part of the ship.

But Andrea didn't go there.  Instead, she went to the door leading
into C-4, and was about to ask what it's pressure was, when she saw it
displayed on the control in the node.  87 kilopascals.  She knew as a
rough rule of thumb that supplemental oxygen wasn't needed until the
pressure dropped to 70 kilopascals.  She keyed the sequence on the
panel that opened the door.  Designed to seal its pressurized contents
against an exterior vacuum, it popped open under the force of the
higher pressure outside, accompanied by a whoosh of air flowing into
the damaged node.  Andrea's sinuses popped under the pressure change.

"I'm going to take a look at the problem in here," Andrea informed
the others as she pushed herself into the node.

On the bridge, the door changed colors on the computer animation of
the ship's layout.

"She just opened the door to C-4!" Alister declared in surprise.

Mercuriou flushed red, clenched his teeth, and smacked his fist
into his palm before finally verbalizing his frustration.

"Dr. Yeats, _as_usual_, _EXACTLY_ where we don't want her to be!"

"That node appears to be damaged, it's loosing pressure, Doctor!"
Burns told the NASA engineer through the intercom.

In C-4, Andrea could hear a quiet whoshing of air.  The node was
definately loosing pressure, but not very fast.

"First of all," she informed Burns as she passed into the center of
the node, "no matter how much reserve oxygen you've got now, this is
the beginning of the mission, so trust me, it's not enough.  And
second," she continued, removing her water bottle from her belt, "it's
a lot easier to find the problem with air in here then with a vacuum."
Carefully, she squeezed the water bottle and released a drop of nearly
stationary fluid into the air, then watched to see where it went.

"She's got some good points, there," Burns mussed aloud on the bridge,
"but I don't like the fact that she doesn't have a spacesuit."  Behind
him, Mercuriou was hardly paying attention as he connected together
the pants and body of his spacesuit, which he rapidly put on.

"Aren't you going to prep?" Alister asked, watching him from the
cockpit.

"I don't have time!" he exclaimed, exasperated.  "What if she gets
stuck in there?"

He shoved the spacesuit's gloves into his helment, then holding them
both with one hand, shoved off with the other towards the airlock,
curtly telling Burns to open it up.

"Opening bridge airlock," Burns stated in a resigned tone of voice as
he keyed the control sequence on the computer panel to his left.

Meanwhile, on Earth, all of the major television networks had by now
interrupted their coverage and were carrying live the video feed from
the spaceship.  On one network, a former astronaut, who now took a
"consulting fee" of two thousand dollars per appearance, speculated
that the situation was developing quickly and could become potentially
serious, with the NASA astronaut trapped and unconscious in the
depressurizing module.  Another network contented itself with a
"science correspondent" holding up an (incorrect) model of the
spaceship and trying to explain where the astronauts were and what was
occuring.  In Washington, the President halted a cabinet meeting to
watch the unfolding events in space.

Meanwhile, Andrea released the harnesses on several large packing
crates and moved them aside to follow the trail of the water droplets.

"Alister, keep reading the pressure off to me," she told the assistant
engineer.

"It's at 82 now," he answered from the bridge.  "It came back up for a
second when you opened the door to C-4, but now it's dropping again."

"Opening B-2," Burns dryly noted as he continued to open pressure
doors in front of the captain, now moving down the central chain of
cargo modules.  Mercuriou bumped against several walls as he went, and
pushed off roughly from them, partly because he hadn't fully learned
how to maneuver in zero-gee, but more because his irate mood grew even
more heated the further he went.

"Opening A-3."

"What are we at Condition Zed for if we're opening all of these
doors?"  Alister asked him.  Burns shrugged in response, contenting
himself with silently closing the doors behind the captain after the
video monitors showed that he had passed.

Meanwhile, Andrea had found the pinhole leak at the root of the
problem.  Unlike the space shuttle, designed for manned spaceflight
operations from the beginning, the cargo modules were just large
pressure tanks with cargo containers secured to their side.  At times
this meant an inconvenient jumble of conduit that could have been
better designed, but in this case it meant easy access to the
punctured wall of the module.

"OK, I found the hole," she announced to the others, "now I need
something to plug it with."  Just as she finished this statement, the
captain propelled himself into C-4, still holding his helmet and
gloves in one hand.

"Excuse me, sir," she said as she reached for his helmet and pulled
one of his gloves out of it.  Turning back to the puncture hole, she
slapped the glove against it.  The interior pressure held the glove
against the wall and stopped the leak.

"Doctor Yeats, we've got to get a few things clear right now,"
he began, then interrupted himself to yell into his microphone.

"Burns, turn off these cameras!"

"Just a minute," Yeats stated, then keyed her own microphone.

"Alister, what's the pressure doing?"

"Uhh.. it's at 75."

"Let me know if it drops any lower.  I think I've got the hole
plugged."

Turning back to the captain, she turned off her microphone and crossed
her arms over her chest.

"Now you wanted to get something clear?" she asked.

Red-faced, Merceriou stared at her for several seconds, then taking
his helmet and one remaining glove, left the cargo module and headed
back to the bridge without saying another word.

Burns finally dealt with the problem by putting the damaged cargo
module, along with a few other empty ones, in front of the others.
The "ground sqwalk", as Mercuriou called the Earth-based media pundits,
began talk of a rescue mission and how much it will cost NASA, and
this is why we need more government regulation in aerospace-related
industry, etc, etc.


T + 4 days

Despite the work going on in orbit, Mercurio always found time for the
media, and at that moment the stunning private space launch was all
the rage.  As soon as Burns had established a network connection from
the ship to the global Internet and announced a network address to the
public, Mercuriou was deluged with email requests for interviews,
product endorcements, technical specifications, and a growing quantity
of both fan mail and hate mail.  Most of it he ignored; he certainly
didn't have the time to read it all.  His next major appearance was on
a prime-time national news program.

"Captain, by all accounts you have stolen hundreds of millions of
dollars, and many people think you could have gotten away with at
least another hundred million undetected.  Why not just take the money
and retire on a beach in Aruba?  Why fly into space?"

"Well, that's a good question.  I guess, basically, I'm 35 years old
and not ready to lounge on a beach just yet.  Spaceflight has always
facinated me, and I want to do something with my life, not just sit
around and enjoy a big pile of cash."

"Couldn't you have raised money for your flight just by being honest
with people about what you were attempting, have say, hey, we're
flying to space, finance us?"

"No, I don't think so.  Look at the X Prize.  They're trying to raise
ten million dollars to reward a private manned spaceflight and have
struggled every step of the way.  Ten million is nothing; you'd be
lucky to get one man into orbit for ten million, heck, you'd be lucky
to put an unmanned satellite into orbit for ten million.  The only
manned space programs are funded by national governments with huge
bankrolls.  Other than that, you've got these commercial satellite
launches backed by large corporations with some kind of scheme to make
the money back, and plenty of those schemes fail.  Let's face it - in
a capitalist society the only way to get anything done is to have some
kind of money-making scheme, some kind of 'business plan', they call
it, and we've got no business plan of any kind for how you can recoup
a billion dollars from this flight or any other.  So the only way to
do it was to either wait for the government, or be independantly
wealthy, or steal it.  I want nothing to do with the government, we're
not independantly wealthy, so we stole it."

"Well, it's interesting that you mention the government space
programs, because I think there was a general belief that you needed a
big government program to accomplish manned spaceflight.  What are
your thoughts on that?"

"Well, if some big government agency had built the first airplane,
everyone would be walking around laughing at the notion that two men
in a bicycle shop could do it.  Building a spacecraft _is_ harder than
building an airplane, but it can be done, and it doesn't require a
couple thousand people to pull it off.  It should be more of a
surprise, at least it is to me, with all the popular culture
surrounding spaceflight, it hasn't been done until now.  Really, it
shows that despite all the hype about freedom, how little opportunity
we really have to pursue our dreams.  It _can_ be done, but we
live in a society hell-bent on forcing people to work, and
telling them constantly that they have freedom."

"So you don't think there is freedom in this society?"

"Why don't you ask all those people you're interviewing?  Ask them if
they'd rather be flying into space or doing whatever mindless job
they've got now, and see what they say?  And be sure to point out to
them that our great capitalist leaders could be mass producing
spacecraft by the thousands if they so desired."

"What do you have to say to the capitalists?  In particular, I'm sure
the executives of many of the companies you tricked are listening to
this program, do you have anything to say to them?"

"Not really.  We didn't steal from Mother Teresa.  The only people
we stole from were capitalists, and they won't lift a finger for
anybody unless they're getting something out of it for themselves."

"So you don't have a problem stealing from capitalists?"

"Why should I?  They're some of the most selfish people in the world,
hell, their whole philosophy is based on greed.  I mean, let's just
apply their own rational.  I'm 'helping them compete'."  Mercuriou's
voice now took on a strong tinge of sarcasm.

"If some of them go out of business, so what?  Businesses fail every
day.  I'm developing technology to fly to Mars, so the whole society
benefits.  We rip and claw at each other throats, and that drives
civilization forward.  This is the capitalist philosophy, isn't it?"

"Well, just to play the devil's advocate, I think a lot of people would
say that we play according to rules, and that you've broken those
rules."

"Who makes up the rules?  The capitalists."

"Well, the rules are made collectively, through a democratic process."

The captain paused a moment before answering.

"You make it sound like everyone agrees on these rules.  If that's the
case, then why do people blow up federal buildings, why do people bomb
our embassies, who do people burn this country's flag?  Obviously,
there's a lot of people who don't agree with these rules, and frankly,
I'm one of them."

"I think many people would say that even though we don't necessarily
agree with all the rules, we obey them anyway and work to change them
democratically."

Mercuriou chuckled.

"Sure, that's why everyone drives the speed limit, because they're so
committed to obeying the rules.  Look, I don't buy any of that.
People obey the rules because they're forced to, because they're
afraid of what will happen to them if don't follow the rules."

"Well, that might be true in a dictatorship, but in a democracy?"

"How's it different?  It's just that the majority makes up the rules
and forces the minorities to obey.  They only thing that's different
about democracy is that it's a different group of people making the
rules.  In Russia it was the proletariat, in Germany it was the Arian
race, here it's the majority.  It's always the same.  Some big bunch
of millions and millions of people that think that because they're
more advanced, or because they've been oppressed, or because there's
more of them than anybody else, that they have the right to rule
everybody else's lives."

"So do you see America as similar to the Soviet Union?"

"Very much so.  It's the same kind of trash that runs it."

"Meaning... the capitalists?"

"Sure.  The communist philosophy was based on brutal, cut-throat class
competition; the fascist philosophy was based on brutal, cut-throat
racial competition; the capitalist philosophy is based on brutal,
cut-throat individual competition.  It's basically the same thing,
slightly editted for a new generation, but with the same kind of
garbage in charge of society.  And I feel as bad about ripping off the
capitalists as I would about ripping off communists or fascists,
because to me they're all basically the same.  Just another bunch of
men with some nightmare system based on the viscious traits of mankind
to be jammed down everyone's throats."

"Well, captain, we're pretty much out of time.  Thank you for
being on the program, and I'm sure we'll talk to you again soon."

"I'm sure you will."

With the exception of Burns, who had his head buried in front of a
computer screen, the rest of the crew had watched the interview from
behind the TV camera.  After it was concluded, Yeats took Mercuriou
aside.

"I was almost ready to jump in there and say a few things myself."

"By all means, doctor, be my guest!"  Mercuriou exclaimed with a
flourish.  "Jump in anytime you please!"



T + 5 days

Mercuriou's next TV appearance was on a political talk show that
usually featured a panel discussion.  This evening the only other
guest was Richard Ecks, a prominent congressman, who had heard his
earlier interview and was determined to rebut him.

"The fact is that capitalism has produced a society with the highest
standard of living that has ever been seen on this planet.  People are
well-fed, well-housed, generally content with their jobs, with a
surplus of leisure time and disposible income.  And yet these
psuedo-socialists insist on slamming capitalism at every turn because
they can't stand the idea of people working hard and getting rewarded
for that hard work.  And now this man comes along, this criminal, who
has taken advantage of our society, stolen from our businesses, lied,
cheated; he comes on this program with the nerve to blame capitalism
for what?  For letting him take advantage of it?  For giving him the
opportunity to pull of one of the greatest con jobs in history?"

Mercurio retorted without waiting for the host to invite him.

"That's quite a nice speech.  The communists also had their speeches.
They loved to go off about how they had put the first man in space,
and how they had brought tractors and steel factories to this
backwards, feudal country, and how everyone was guaranteed an
education, and health care, and retirement, and how wonderful
communism was.  And the fascists loved to talk about their Zeppelin
airships, and their autobahns, and how they had pulled Germany out of
a worldwide recession, and how they were rebuilding their Reich and
how wonderful fascism was.  And it's all true, but at some point you
step back and see some kind of objective truth.  Every one of these
great societies was run by a bunch of garbage leaders with some
screwball system based on the most viscious traits of mankind, and
captialism is no exception.  Its leaders are about the most selfish
sons of bitches you'd ever want to meet in your life, and the simple
truth is that you either work for these bastards or you starve.  So if
you want want Zeppelins, or Sputniks, or Microsoft Windows, and these
material things are more important to you than your freedom, then
should pick whichever one of these brutal philosophies most appeal to
you and go sign up."

"Capitalism may not be perfect," the legislator fired back, "and this
society may not be perfect, but what sets us apart from communism and
fascism is our commitment to democracy and freedom.  Those countries
were dictatorships.  This country is run by its people, through their
elected representatives, and the capitalists don't simply 'own' the
government, and they don't always get their way."

"You make it sound like a utopia!  Why do you have the second-largest
per capita incarceration rate on this planet, if everything
thinks it's so wonderful?"

"Well, there's always the criminal element who thinks they can
side-step everyone else, isn't there, 'Captain'?  The fact is that
capitalism works.  It certainly works for all the decent, hard-working
people who have the opportunity to better themselves instead of being
stuck in a rice paddy somewhere!"

"You mean it works for all the selfish creeps who are willing to claw
over everyone else to 'better themselves', or more precisely to have a
nice house, a couple nice cars, and take their vacation on Maui..."

"There's nothing wrong with having a nice house, Captain, so
long as you're honest in how you pay for it."

"OK, I'm going to give you a perfect example of how capitalism
'works', Congressman.  Fifteen years ago, I and a college friend of
mine developed a computer program to aid people in reading Greek
literature; I majored in classical languages.  This was before the
World Wide Web, but basically this was a rudimentary hypertext system.
You could load any Greek text into the program, and it would display
it on the screen.  If you came across a word you didn't understand,
you could click on it with the mouse, the program would look it up in
a Greek-English dictionary and display the entry at the bottom of the
screen.  It was a lot faster than flipping pages in a dictionary,
trust me, and a great learning tool.  I finished the last half of the
_Iliad_ using it, and it was like night and day compared to old way of
stopping at every other word and looking it up in a different book."

[I wrote this program, only it works for Spanish rather than Greek.
Unlike our hero, I didn't even bother to try and publish it, for all
the same reasons.  It sits on my computer disk, waiting for a freely
available Spanish-English dictionary.]

"We put a lot of work into it, Congressman; we made sure that it could
handle all the irregular verb forms; we developed several different
user interfaces, for Machintosh and Windows and UNIX.  We put a copy
up on the Internet.  We started telling a lot of people in the
classics community about it and started getting some really good
feedback.  We had plans to develop a Latin version, too.  Then came
along the publishers of the dictionary - the capitalists."

"See, we had just taken a Greek-English dictionary that we had on one
of the computers at the university and incorporated it into the
program.  When we put the program up on the network, we of course
included the dictionary, because the program was pretty useless
without it.  A lot of people thought our program was a great idea, but
the publishers of the dictionary didn't.  They sued us for copyright
infringement."

"Now the funny thing was, they were willing to cut a deal, of course.
If we took the program down off the network, changed it into a
for-profit product and paid them a royalty on every copy we sold, we
could use their dictionary!  But we couldn't use it just to let people
download the program for free.  I decided to fight.  I still believed
in the great free democracy back them.  After a year-long legal battle
that I lost, I ended up with a court injunction against me for four
hundred thousand dollars in damages, and for what?  Because I worked
hard, developed a useful product, and was decent enough to want to see
it available to everyone who wanted a copy.  I'm still waiting for
that house, by that way."

"Well, Captain, it sounds to me like you were guilty!"  the
congressman fired back.  "That sounds like a real noble cause, but the
bottom line is that you stole someone else's intellectual property and
published it without their permission.  You seem to have a problem
with authority."

"You're damn right I've got a problem with authority!  I've got a
problem with authority when the people in authority are just a bunch
of self-serving creeps!  Now why couldn't we have just put that
program up on the network?  What is so terrible about that?"

"Captain, again, the bottom line is that it wasn't your property.  The
publishers of that dictionary, whoever they are, could have chosen to
publish it for free, but it's their property and their choice.  I'm
sure they put as much work into as you did into your program, maybe
more, and they chose to sell it, and there's nothing wrong with that."

"There's a hell of a lot wrong with it.  People should be generous,
not selfish, especially the _leaders_ of society.  That program, that
dictionary, and all the other ones like it should be freely available
on our computer networks!"

Ecks laughed out loud.

"And, of course, who's going to pay for those dictionaries, Captain,
the government, right?  Who's going to make all those evil capitalists
put those dictionaries on the Internet, the government, right?  It's
the same old tired story of socialism all over again."

"Look, I'm no great politician, and I can't lay out some big complex
scheme for paying those dictionaries, and I'm no great philospher
either, but I can tell you that a bunch of men who want all this
information kept secret so they can make money on it are a bunch of
trash leaders of a trash society!"

"I know, everyone who wants to make money is trash, everyone who just
wants a better life for themselves and their children is trash,
Captain!"

"No, Congressman, but a bunch of men determined to outlaw twenty-first
century public libraries before they're ever been created _are_ trash,
sir, they are!  This society isn't going to be remembered for all this
so-called freedom, let me assure you.  It's going to remembered for
all the information it kept secret.  All the design information for
the computers, all the source code, all the circuit diagrams, all the
manufacturing processes!  It's all kept secret by these capitalists
determined to keep the whole world dependent on them and their
nightmare system.  They talk about 'freedom', 'freedom', and the only
freedom they're interested in is their own!  It's not about making
money, it's about how you treat people, and the capitalists treat
people like dirt!"

"They don't treat..." the Congressman started, but never finished,
as he was interrupted by the now incensed space captain.

"Shut up, you capitalist son-of-a-bitch, shut up!  You no good
bastard, you sit there with your jacket and tie on and try to defend a
bunch of bums that won't lift a finger for anyone unless they're
getting something out of it for themselves!  What is so terrible about
public libraries?  What is so terrible about information being free?
What is so terrible about taking these books and putting them up on
our networks for anyone to read and use?"

"Who the hell are you to tell someone else what they can and can't do
with their property?!?!" Ecks fired back, now furious himself.  "How
dare you, how dare you, you socialist crook, you shameless thief, how
dare you tell someone who's sweated tears and blood that they have to
give everything away for free?!  How dare you?!!?"

A moment of silence fell on the program before Mercuriou answered
in a calmer voice.

"I'll dare right now, I'll dare to tell you that we could build a
twenty-first century library of Alexandria, that we could take every
book in every library on this planet, scan it, and put it up on that
network, but that's not what our leaders want.  They want an
"information economy", where knowledge is just one more commodity to
bought and sold, and the only way people will pay for it is if it's
kept secret.  That's the sick truth about your 'global capitalist
economic system'."

"Simply put, in this country we have freedom.  If we have capitalism,
it's because the people choose it."  The speaker was David Wye, a
U.S. senator.  Mercuriou was once again in a televised debate.

"Well, senator, I'll agree with you that this is a democracy, but I
don't think that changes things much.  Let's say Russia had had
freedom of speech, and freedom of the press, and free and open
elections every two or four years, and they had still elected the
communists, and still supported the KGB, and still shipped their
citizens off to gulags.  Would that have changed things all that much,
just that they had elections?"

"No sir, the people of these country don't support the KGB, and we
don't ship our citizens off to gulags!"

"Oh, but you do.  Haven't you heard about 'zero tolerance'?  Haven't
you heard about the War on Drugs?  Don't you watch C.O.P.S?  It has
got to be one of the most violent programs on television, and it's all
real!  Remember who you're talking to, senator - a drug user!  Don't
expect me to sit here and crow on about freedom while this whole
society is hell-bent on a war against me and everyone else like me.
You do ship your citizens off to jail, and while you may not torture
them, and your prisons may not be as cold as the ones in Siberia, the
fact remains that fear of the police is just as readily used in this
society as in those others."

"I don't think you can compare the DEA with the KGB."

"I do.  The basic premise is the same.  The solution to our problems
is to have a war against our own people, to send armed men busting
into the homes of people who have done absolutely nothing to harm
anyone, to make people so terrified of what will be done to them that
they'll be too afraid not to just fall in line and do what they're
told when the great majority barks out its orders.  Isn't it funny how
in all of these great _people's_ societies the biggest enemy of all
always ends up being _your_own_people_?"

"OK, sir, we have a Constitution..."

"So did they; so did they," Mercurio glibbly noted.

"Our Constitution is enforced!  Our Constitution restrains the power
of our government..."

"Really?  Let's take a look."

"Oh, please..."

"No, let's take a look!  You've made this absurd claim that our government
is restrained by its Constitution; let's get the thing out and take a look
at it!"

"OK, fine!" Wye interjected, determined not to be shown up.  "Let's
get a copy of the Constitution and look at it!"

Mercurio was already ahead of him.  He had grabbed his laptop,
pulled up a copy of the American Constitution, and prepared to start
reading from it.

"Let's start with the powers of Congress.  Article one, section eight.
Now, congressman, stop me if at any point you hear anything about
regulating the use of drugs, or radio communications, or agriculture,
or the environment, or..."

"All right, all right, first of all, many of these problems didn't exist
two hundred years ago, there was no drug abuse, no radio, the environment
wasn't an issue..."

"So we should just ignore our Constitution whenever some new problem
comes up; it only applies to our old problems?"

"You want to go through the Constitution section by section?  How
about Ammendment One, Freedom of Speech; Ammendment Two, the Right to
Bear Arms; the guarantees of due process, the election procedures,
this is absurd!"

"Fine!  Fine!  Let's keep going, too!  Don't forget the tenth
Ammendment, how's it read?"

Mercuriou quoted the document word-for-word from his laptop.

"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to
the people."  [italics]

"OK!  So here it is clearly stated that the federal government
_does_not_ have any of these additional powers!  No right to regulate
communications, of radio or any other form!  No right to regulate drug
use!  No right to regulate firearms!"

Wye laughed, the forced laugh of a man caught somewhat off-guard by an
opponent better prepared than he.

"Look, there are sound legal arguments behind all of these laws..."

"So what, only a lawyer can understand the Constitution?"

"No, you don't need to be a lawyer to understand the Constitution,
but this notion that half the federal government is unconstitutional
is simply absurd!"

"It says it right here that the government _does_not_ have these
powers!
_The_powers_not_delegated_to_the_United_States_by_the_Constitution ...
_are_reserved_to_the_States_.  What good's a law when you pick and
choose what parts of it you want to obey?  Fine, so you obey parts of
the Constitution, but what about the other parts?  This is like me
blowing down the highway at ninety miles an hour, and when the cop
pulls me over saying, 'oh, but officer, I came to a full and complete
stop at all the red lights'!"

"OK," the moderator interjected, trying to bring the discussion under
control.  "Senator, Captain Mercurio certainly isn't the first person
to accuse the Federal Government of circuventing the Constitution.  Is
there nothing to any of these claims?"

"No, and I'll tell you why," Wye replied.  "All these things the
anti-government people gripe about - gun control, the drug war, the
environmental laws, the FCC - all of them are supported by the
overwealming majority of the people of this country."

"I'll agree with that," the space captain replied, "but I'd still like
to see these additional powers codified in Constitutional Ammendments,
and I'll tell you why.  One of the big accusations people made against
Soviet Russia was that their government didn't obey their
Constitution.  I don't want anybody being able to come around a
hundred years from now and try to say that this wasn't really a
democracy, that the people didn't really want these things, that some
bunch of politicians took over the government.  This government, this
majority, talks so much about law and order, is so determined to make
all these rules for everyone else to obey, I'd just like to see them
have to obey the rules that were laid down for them.  It's a bit of a
side issue, but I'd really like a precedent established that the
powers of the government are limited by the Constitution."

[Maybe more in here about the FCC and the problems of radio networking.]

"The government is limited by its Constitution.  That's one of the
fundamental principles of American government."

"How can you sit there and say that!  How can you read the Bill of
Rights, and in particular the Ninth and Tenth Ammendments, then sit
there and say that!  I can't even call it a lie!  It just flys in the
face of the English language!"

"Again, Captain, it comes back to self-government.  The bottom line is
that this is what the majority of the people want!  And what they want
is freedom!"

"The majority!"  Mercuriou spit the word out in disgust.  "That's what
it's all comes down to!  The majority isn't restricted by their
constitution, constitutions are only for communist dictatorships!  And
then you talk about 'freedom'!  Senator, turn on the T.V!  Don't you
see the police slamming people to the ground and dragging them off in
handcuffs!"

"Criminals!  Criminals!  People who break our laws!"

Mercuriou would have lept out of his chair, but of course, he
had no chair.  He was floating free in the cabin of the 747,
so had to be content with a bizarre gestation of his arms
before firing back his retort.

"Senator, _I'm_one_of_those_criminals_!  Because I smoke marijuana!
Because I copy computer software from 'C' drive to 'D' drive!  Because
I don't concede to this God-damned, filthy, cursed democracy that it
can control every aspect of my life, no matter how private, that it
can literally tell me what I can and can't put into my own body!  And
then you sit there are talk about 'freedom', you dirty son of a
bitch!"

"We do have freedom in this country!" Wye practically screamed back at
the camera in retort.  "We have freedom of speech, freedom of the
press, free elections!"

"The issue isn't how much freedom this 'majority' has got.  It's what
they've chosen to do with it!  They've chosen to build a society based
on some of the most vicious traits of mankind; they've chosen the most
selfish bastards as their leaders; they've chosen to arm themselves to
the teeth, build some nightmare society, declare war against millions
of their own people because they won't just do what their told when
the great free democracy barks out its orders, and then jam it down
their throats at gunpoint!"

"Excuse me," came a female voice from just outside camera range, and
Andrea Yeats propelled herself into view.

"Excuse me, but I really don't think the issue is freedom.  The issue
is morality.  Freedom has to be used morally, and I think the objections
of Captain Mercuriou and people like him come down to morality.
They believe, and I tend to agree, that the majority of people have
freedom, but have abused it and used it immorally."

"Well, who's going to define this morality, Doctor Yeats," came the
response from Earth.  "Who's going to tell people what they can and
can't do with their freedom?"

"Morality is a function of religion.  We Christians look to the
Bible and its gospel teachings to define morality."

"Well, we've got freedom of religion in this country, Doctor!"

"Freedom of religion is fine up to a point, but somewhat unrealistic..."

"It's not unrealistic, Doctor, we've got it!  What you advocate is
something we abandoned centuries ago, that there should be some
prefered religion!"

"Well, you've got to have a prefered religion..."

"Got to have a prefered religion!"  Wye echoed her words with a sneer.
"Doctor Yeats, I hate to break this to you, but you're about two
hundred years behind the times!  Ever heard of the Salem Witch
Trials?"

The NASA engineer turned red and practically ripped the microphone
off her shirt before fleeing from the TV cameras.  Mercuriou
jumped into the gap.

"OK, now you're back to picking on someone your own size!"

Later, Mercuriou found Yeats back working in C-3.

"So what where you talking about there?  You've got to have a hide of
steel to debate those bastards; it's like a blood sport.  They're not
trying to have some intellectual debate; they'll stoop to any low to
get their sound bite and 'win'."

Yeats brushed back the long blond hair that was starting to
drift in front of her face.

"What I was trying to say was that you just can't have a human society
without some kind of shared standard of morality, and that's one of
the main functions of relgiion. I mean, how can you judge right or
wrong?  Why can't someone say that his religion allows human
sacrifice, for example?  Where's your freedom of religion then?"

"I'll tell you what their prefered religion is - it's democracy!"
Mercuriou responded.  "The murderer can't make his human sacrifice
because the majority won't allow it!  I can't smoke pot because
the majority has decided to outlaw it!  Our ship's library
is illegal because that's what the majority has decided to call it!
Right and wrong are subject to a vote, now, Andrea."

"Well, I don't beleive right and wrong are subject to a vote, and I
know you don't, either.  I think half of what religion is, heck, maybe
90% of what religion is is giving us standards to judge right and
wrong.  Murder isn't wrong because it's illegal, it's wrong because
it's immoral, and you can't decide what's moral and immoral without
religion.  So that's why I think freedom of religion, or more precisly
seperation of religion from public life, is a chimera.  You can have
freedom to go to whatever church you want, but you can't have a
society without some kind of shared norm of morality, and that means
religion."

Mercuriou thoought about this for a minute.

"You know, you've got a good point there, Doctor - morality!  Maybe
it's something I don't talk enough about.  These people crow on to no
end about 'freedom', but they don't want to talk about morality!"

... the next day ...

Mercuriou had taken the conversation with Yeats to heart, and
when the interview started was absolutely determined to discuss morality.

"Every murder ever committed in human history was perpetrated by a
murderer who had freedom!  Every rape, every theft!  Every slave was
enchained by the _freedom_ of his master, yes _freedom_!  I'm
so sick of listening to you people crow on about 'freedom'!
Freedom in the absence of morality is the single most destructive
force this planet has _ever_ seen!"


T + 7 days

"The majority don't want good leaders."

Perhaps because of his attitude, perhaps because of the media
attention heaped on him, perhaps because of his position in orbit,
completely beyond the reach of any terrestrial authority, or perhaps
simply because of what he said, Mercuriou seemed to incite the ire of
nearly all the American political leaders, regardless of party
affiliation or personal temperment.  At any rate, he was back on
television.  In another debate, he faced off against one of the most
country's most prominent politicians, a state governor widely expected
to run for president in an upcoming election.

"The majority don't want good leaders," the astronaut repeated,
floating weightless on the screens of 10 million people watching the
live program.  "They want garbage leaders.  They want the most selfish
bastards you'd ever want to meet, with this nightmare capitalist
system based on the most vicious traits of mankind to be jammed down
everyone's throats.  And this time, nobody can say it isn't really a
democracy, that one man took over the government, that the dissidents
were 'disappeared', that we don't have freedom of speech or freedom of
the press.  Nobody can claim that this isn't really what the majority
of people want."

"So you actually do think the majority of the American people support
their government?" the moderator asked.

"Yes, and that's really the problem - populist government - this
stupid idea that you can put the masses of people in charge of
society.  It was talked about by philophers in the eigthteenth
century, brought to power in Europe and the Americas by a string of
revolutions in the nineteenth, and brought to fuition in the twentieth
century.  What it produced was fascism, communism, and capitalism -
three of the most depraved societies that have every been seen on the
face of this planet.  Fascism, based on brutal, viscious, racial
competition; communism, based on brutal, viscious, class competition;
and capitalism, based on brutal, viscious individual competition.
Now, tell me, what do all of these things have in common... other than
the fact that millions upon millions upon millions of people went
chasing off after every one of them?"

"Communism wasn't a democracy, or a populist goverment..." Zee began
to retort, but Mercurio cut him off.

"Then how did they win their Civil War in Russia?  The Whites had all
the old czarist military officers, they had foreign aid from the
United States and Great Britian, the Reds were isolated and on their
own, yet still they managed to win that war!  How did they did that if
nobody supported them?"

"The communists lied to their people..." Zee began.

"Oh no they didn't!  You want to understand communism, read the last
page of the Communist Manifesto, where Marx and Engles talk about
letting the world tremble in fear of a communist revolution.  _That_'s
communism - stick AK-47s in the hands of the peasants and let the
world tremble in fear!  That's what all those people wanted -
expropriate the expropriators and let everyone tremble in fear!"

The astronaut went on without waiting for a response.

"Communism was one of the biggest populist movements of the twentieth
century!  Practically every country in existance had some kind of
communist insurgancy!  They took over half this planet!  Millions upon
millions of people _believed_ in communism!  To claim that the
communists were some tiny bunch of dictators flies in the face of
history!  Take Vietnam - why were all those 15-year-olds hauling
AK-47s around the Mekong Delta if the communists were just some tiny
cliche holed up in the Kremlin?!"

"The communists installed brutal dictatorships in every country they
took power in!"  Zee shot back.  "Look at the people in Russia!  If
communism is so populist, why did they need another revolution to take
back their government!"

"Because once the communists got entrenched it was almost impossible
to remove them, just like it'd be almost impossible to remove the
capitalists from power the west - they control everything!  If
communism wasn't populist, then why did a third of the Russian
electorate vote for Zyuganov in 1996?  And this is part of an ongoing
trend that has made the Communist Party the single largest political
party in Russia!  Now what possible explanation is there for this
except that millions upon millions of Russians _to_this_day_ support
communism?!"

Mercuriou paused briefly before continuing in a calmer voice.

"The problem with communism wasn't their economic system, it wasn't
the structure of their elections, it wasn't their lack of
constituional guarentees.  The problem with communism was that their
leaders were a bunch of trash with some nightmare system to be jammed
down everyone's throats, and _millions_of_people_supported_them_!
They were a lot like the people who run democracy today!"

"The problem isn't Bill Gates.  The problem is John Doe.  Walk into
one of these stores anywhere in the Western world without a credit
card or a twenty dollar bill in hand.  Ask for a plate of food.  See
what you walk out with.  The fact is that the majority of people are
crude, selfish, and violent.  That's why communism came to power in
these backwards countries - if the people have nothing, tell them to
expropriate the exproriators at gunpoint - it sounds great!  Now in
the more developed nations, the majority have a lot more material
possessions, expropriating the expropriators doesn't sound nearly as
good, better to just build some brutal society where those who have
can keep it and don't lift a finger for anyone else.  The bottom line
is that the majority of people are selfish - both capitalism and
communism play to that, just on different sides of the coin."

"Next I guess you'll be telling us that the German people elected
Hitler in 1932," Zee dryly observed.

"Well, the next thing I'll tell you is that the German people elected
the Nazis in 1932."

"Oh, please, Hitler's Germany was one of the most brutal dictatorships..."

"That the people elected!  That the people elected!  In 1932, the Nazis
won a third of the vote in the last free election..."

"A third!"  Zee fired back.  "Not a majority!"

"Hey, if you can get a third of the people to support you, you can get
half.  Anyway, they got more votes than any other political party;
they won a plurality.  They got enough votes to make Hermann Goering
president of the Reischtag, enough votes to defeat Von Papen's
government on a vote of no-confidence, enough votes to create a
situtation where Adolf Hitler was basically the only viable choice for
German chancellor.  Generally speaking, that means they won the
election!"

Zee and the moderator were both silent, perhaps in a stunned sort of
way, and the _Icarus_ commander stormed on.

"Over thirteen million people voted Nazi in 1932!  Thirteen million!
And this in a nation of only about eighty million total!  Yes, Hitler
proceeded to build a dictatorship, but a dictatorship with the support
of thirteen million people!  And don't say that the German people
didn't knew what they were getting.  Read the first chapter, the first
page, of _Mein_Kampf_!  The part where Hitler talks about 'the moral
right of armed conquest'!  That book was a best-seller in Germany!
That's what those people voted for - 'the moral right of armed
conquest'!  People supported the Nazis for basically the same reason
people supported the communists and the same reason people today
support the capitalists - because they were brutal as hell, and that's
what works in the "real world" and that's all these millions and
millions of people "know"!  I'm telling you... democracy is another
communism!"

"Another communism?" the moderator cut it, stunned.

"That's right.  It's another big pile of books and theories that sound
real good on paper, and in practice has produced some of the most
depraved societies that's every been seen on the face of this planet.
People will look back on this a hundred years from..."

It was more than Zee could take.  Visibly redening, now it was
the governor's turn to cut off the space captain.

"Look here, democracy may not be perfect, but it's a damn sight better
than just about anything else out there.  In the last 200 years, we've
abolished slavery, and that alone has to count as one of the biggest
achieve..."

Mercurio cut right back in.  The debate had turned into an
intellectual free-for-all.

"Abolished slavery!  In the bloodiest war this country has ever had!
Is that what it will take to abolish capitalism?  To end the Drug War?
I don't know how many more 'successes' like the Civil War this country
can afford.  But the communists abolished slavery, too.  That isn't
the point.  The point..."

"Yes it is the point!  Yes it is! Don't go brushing off everything
this country's accompished just 'cause you can't see anything but it's
faults!  We're not perfect, but the majority of this country's people
are decent, hardworking folk who want a better life not just for
themselves, but for decent people everywhere!  And unlike these
dictatorships, and I do mean _dictatorships_, we have a legitamtite
system of government."

"And just what is a legitamite government, anyway?"

A pause fell over the broadcast, and Mercurio repeated his question.
"What is a legitimate government?"

"A democratically elected body with the support of the people."

"You mean the support of the majority?"

"Well, the people are..."

"The people are the majority?  And what about the minority?  I guess they're
not people, huh?"

"The rights of the minorities have to be protected, but the overwheling
majority of people support democracy, even if they don't win a particular
election..."

"Of course they support it - they're the majority!  Basically, the
only legimitate form of government is democracy, right?  Everything
else is illegimiate, and if your government is illegimiate, you
basically have no rights, there is no international law for you, so
better buddy up with the U.S. or you might find the SEALs airdropping
on your international airport one morning."

Mercuriou paused for breath, and the newsman chose this moment to
jump in and try to bring the debate back under control.  He decided to
do it by challenging one of the astronaut's more dramatic claims.

"Gentlemen, please.  Captain Mercurio, many people critize the United
States, but another communism?  You can't be serious."

"Look here, it's the same with all these populist governments,"
Mercurio replied.

"Populist?" the congressmen retorted.

"Yes, _populist_," the spaceman replied.  "Communism was one of the
biggest mass populist movements of the twentieth centry.  Millions of
people in Germany voted Nazi.  This is the truth about populist
government.  The masses of people are selfish and violent.  That's why
they chose people like the communists and the fascists and the
capitalists to be their leaders!"

Governor Zee looked like he was ready to reach through the TV
monitor and rip the spaceman's head off.  He replied in clipped,
measured tones that betrayed the rage he felt at his floating nemisis.

"Capitalism is totally different from communism.  Communism was a
brutual, murderous dictatorship.  And I want to be very clear on that
word - dictatorship.  There was nothing populist about it in the
least."

"Nothing populist about communism?  Then how did it manage to take
over half this planet?  It was the same with the Nazis, elected in
1932, and yes, despite every attempt to claim the contrary, they were
_elected_; France, the French Revolution, whose leaders talked about
liberty, fraternity, and equality, then built guilateons in the public
squares of Paris and chopped off the heads of the nobelmen.  Europe's
first democracy - and every one of those men was elected - Coulton,
Saint Just, Robspierre, and of course, finally, Napoleon."

"Napoleon was elected?" Black sneered.

"He could have been.  He could have won any election in that country.
Bonaparte was one of France's most popular leaders."

"This has been the broken record of democracy for the last two hundred
years.  All these people talk about these grandeose ideas of liberty
and freedom, and then choose absolute garbage for their leaders, and
build societies based on the basest and most vicious traits of
mankind.  This time around it's the capitalists - the most selfish
sons of bitches you'd ever want to meet, and the majority support
these bums every step of the way.  And of course they can't spend
enough money to build the most lethal killing machines this planet has
ever seen.  This is what the majority of people want - the
capitalists, the most selfish men you'd ever want to meet, and the
democrats, who are going to get tough with anybody who won't follow
all these laws.  Real good leaders."

Mercurio stopped, and Zee didn't retort immediately.  A tense silence
fell over the television program.  Across the country, millions of
people in their homes murmorred amongst themselves.  "I don't want to
hear any more of this."  "You tell 'em, Marc!"  "That bastard deserves
to die up there!"  "I hope the whole bunch die!"  "Is this what people
think about us?"

In New York, the broadcast was nearing it's end.  There would be
plenty more opportunities for debate.

"Captain, what are your plans?  How long can you stay in orbit?"

Mercurio rumaged in a storage bin and sent clothes flying all over the
compartment.  Finally, he pulled out the T-shirt he was looking for,
brushed away a pair of jeans that had drifted in front of the TV
camera and spread the black T-shirt out so it dominated the view field
of the camera.  It read: FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING FUCKS. []

[This T-shirt isn't original.  A friend of mine has one.]

"We're going to Mars!"


T + 11 days

"Well, most human societies have been like this, but not all."

Despite all the attention heaped on the Merceriou and his
wildly anti-democratic views, there were other crew members
on the spaceship, and now Vic was taking his turn at the mic.

"I think the American Indians were the best example of an alternative.
They raised their children to recognize wild edibles, to make fire by
rubbing sticks together, to build a bow and arrows from natural
materials that you'd find lying around a forest.  By the time they
were fifteen years old, they could literally walk out into the woods
and take care of themselves.  So you couldn't have a government, at
least not in form you know it.  Government is based on coersion.  How
can you coerce people who can just walk out into the woods if they get
ticked off?  This is why murder and other violent crimes were almost
unknown in these 'primitive' societies.  This is why the federal
government couldn't have been nearly so coercive two hundred years
ago.  Anyone who didn't like it could just pack up and move west."

"So we should give up our technology and go back to living like
Indians?"  X asked sarcastically.

"It might not be a bad idea.  The human race is too primitive for
all this technology.  You'd probably be better off living in the
woods; happier, too."

"Funny, I don't see you living in the woods right now, Doctor."

Vic chuckled.  X didn't.  Neither did Captain Merceriou, watching
the broadcast with the rest of the crew from alongside the
camera, just outside its field of view.

"All things in moderation, congressman, all things in moderation.
What I'm trying to say is that industrialization had radically
transformed human society, and the shock waves are still being felt.
In the last hundred years, well, two hundred years in Europe, but a
hundred years in the U.S. and the rest of the civilized world, we've
gone from a primarily agraian society to a primarily industrial one;
we've gone from people living on farms to people living in cities.
That means people are dependent on each other to an extent never seen
before, and that exasperates the problems of society.  The fact is,
most human societies are based on coersion, on greed, on the
domination of man over man, of the strong over the weak.  The more
industrialized society becomes, the more dependent people are on
society and each other, the more oppressive society becomes.  There's
just no way around this, unless a hundred million people are going to
wake up one day and suddenly decide to change their human nature, to
abandon greed for generosity, force for persuasion, and that's just
not going to happen."

"Well, I hate to break the news to you, but it has happened.  It's
called democracy.  Maybe you've been living in the woods too long to
have noticed that the entire operation of our government is based on
persuasion.  That's why every four years men contest to become
president, and the way they do that is through giving speechs, running
advertisements, talking to voters, and the whole point is to persuade,
Doctor, persuade, not force, people to vote for them."

Mercuriou could take no more.  He propelled himself into the camera's
field of view, bumping into Vic and sending him clutching for a
strap to neutralize his momentum.

"You sound like a fucking communist!" he snarled at the camera,
while in New York Koppel winced as the broadcast profanity.

"Humanity_has_abandoned_greed_and_force_and_this_great_event_goes_by
the_name_of_democracy!" he continued in a sarcastic drawl.  "Well, if
your government is so based on persuation, then why do you have the
second highest per capita incarceration rate on the planet?  Why every
time you turn on C.O.P.S, you see the police chasing after
'criminals', gang-tackling them, and dragging them off to prison?  Why
are you screaming for war on your own people and zero tolerance for
your own children?  The only people that the democrats persuade are
the majority.  Everyone else is ruled through threat and fear.  The
majority act real nice and polite to each other, then scream for the
criminal's blood and elect all these men who talk about cracking down
and getting tough, and how wonderful a world it is where anybody can
start a business and ruthlessly try to compete in this brutual
capitalist system.  The majority are perfectly willing to resort to
force; they do it _every_single_day_."

The moderator cut in before Ecks could get more than a word off.

"OK, captain, but we're interviewing Dr. Antonov now.  Doctor, what's
your opinion on democracy?"

Vic had now righted himself in the camera's view, and paused a moment,
thinking and licking his lips, before responding.  To the surprise of
many viewers, everyone else on the program waited, too.

"As I said, I think all government, all society, really, is coercive.
The larger and more inter-dependent a society is, the more coercive it
is.  I don't think the issue is so much democracy but
industrialization, and I don't think you can design a system of
government to fix a society that isolates people from nature, raises
them so they don't have a clue how to feed themselves without a
Safeway, teaches them all this science and mathematics, sends them
running around in cars and airplanes but neglects to teach them how to
live in harmony with nature, how to quiet their soul, how to look into
the depths of their being and find out who we really are, and what our
genuine vision of ourselves really is."

"Want to take a crack at it?" Mercuriou asked Alister after the
broadcast was concluded, indicating the camera with an arm gesture.

The South African emphatically shook his head 'no'.  Burns, who had
gone right back to work on a computer console even before the
conclusion of the interview, never looked up.


T + 13 days

After her one ill-fated attempt to butt in, Andrea had let Mercuriou
have the debates to himself.  One thing was for sure, though, and that
was that the crew of the _Icarus_, loved or hated, had become media
darlings, and Yeats was one of the big 'gets' for a TV interview.
Rather than returning to Mercuriou's format, Andrea decided to accept
an offer for a one-on-one interview from a prominent female journalist
with a reputation for objectivity.

"Captain Mercurio says the problem is democracy, that it's another
communism.  Do you agree?"

The NASA engineer thought for a moment before answering.

"Not really.  The problem is human nature.  Democracy is just another
political system.  In some ways it's better than others, in some ways
worse.  Ultimately, the solutions to our problems are spiritual and
not political.  Unfortunately, democracy tends to accentuate a lot of
problems, because you can't just go blame it off on some dictator."

"How does democracy accentuate problems?"

"Well, the problems have always been there.  Democracy shows us that
the problems aren't caused because people don't have political
representation.  Now people do have political representation, and a
lot of the problems are still here.  So, just giving political power
to the masses of people doesn't magically solve your problems."

"Dr. Yeats, you mentioned a moment ago that democracy is better than
some political systems, worse than others, or something to that
effect.  If I'm not reading too much into your words, can you give us
an example of a superior political system?"

"Well, I don't know if there are any superior political systems.  Like
I said, our problems are spiritual more than political, and thus we
need spiritual solutions more so than political ones.  Now take a
monarch like King Arthur; you can have a good king, genuinely
interested in caring for his people, and yes, you can have a good
monarchy."

"Do you advocate monarchy as a system of government?"

"I don't advocate anything as a system of government.  I advocate
Christianity as a system for people to live their lives.  Monarchy is
like any other system of government, you might get a good king for a
while, but eventually you'll get a bad one, so it's no answer.  If you
go back to the Old Testament, first Samuel, I think, you find the
people actually _demanding_ a king!  We have this idea today that a
king is somehow imposed on people against their will, but in those
days it was the commonly accepted form of government.  And Samuel
basically told those people that they didn't need a king, that all
they needed was to follow the will of God, but they didn't want to
hear it.  So they got their king, it was Saul, and Samuel told them
again that if they and their king followed the will of God, things
would work out well for them, but if they didn't, there would be
problems.  It's a lot the same today.  People don't need a king, and
they don't need a democracy.  They need to follow the will of God, but
of course you've got half of them screaming that militant capitalism
_is_ the will of God, so there you go."

"So, doctor, I'm, I'm not sure exactly what you mean when you say
that you advocate Christianity rather than any system of government.
For example, what do you say to Captain Mercurio's very vocal
criticisms of western society?"

The astronaut paused before responding.

"I think he makes a lot of good points, but this has been human
society since the dawn of time.  Take Saint Anthony of the Desert, for
example.  God appeared to him in a vision and told him to flee from
men, so he went to live in the desert, and founded the Christian
monastic tradition.  This was during the Roman Empire, when Christians
were thrown to the lions, so these problems have been around for a
while."

"Haven't we come a long ways from that?  We don't throw Christians to
the lions anymore."

"No, we don't, thank God, but it's still tough to live as Christians.
Generally, the people who rise to the top in human society do so
by abandoning Christian values, so living as a Christian generally
means that you're going to get a lot of doors slammed shut on you."

"Could you elaborate on that?  How do people not live as Christians?"

"Well, look around.  Christ gave us two great commandments, to love
God with all our hearts, and to love our neighbors as ourselves.  And
he elaborated on them, and lived them in his own life.  I think the
second commandment is more obvious than the first; we look around and
see how we don't love each other as Christ taught, that's more obvious
that how we fail God."

"Could you be more specific; I'm not trying to be dense, but
why don't you think a Christian can rise to the top in our society?"

"Well, consider what Christ said.  He taught us to give to all those
who beg from us; that if someone asked to borrow from us we should
give without expecting anything in return.  If you do that, if you
give to all, you often end up with nothing, at least nothing material."

"Capitan Mercuriou has talked about making books and dictionaries
freely available and has been accused of theft.  Do you support
intellectual property rights?"

"Well, I think it's somewhat of a mute issue.  Christ said that if a
man steals your coat, you should give him your cloak as well - you
love your enemies, and not just in an abstract sense, either, you
really try to do good for your enemies.  So if someone steals your
intellectual property, the Christian response is the same as to any
other theft - you make sure the thieves have got the latest and most
up-to-date versions of your books or software.  When you take that
kind of an attitude, I think you quickly reach a point where you just
say that you'll publish all this information anyway, I mean, why would
you give to a thief, but withhold from someone who just asks
politely?"

"So do you advocate a welfare system of some kind?"

"Well, no, not if I understand your question, because welfare to me
implies some kind of government operation.  Christ didn't tell us to
give our money to the government to run welfare, he didn't tell us to
give our money to the church so it could fund charities, he told us,
he spoke to us as individuals, he said _you_, give to all those who
beg of _you_.  So, if you see someone standing by the road begging,
you stop and give them a dollar or two, if you see someone asking for
a ride, you pull over and ask them where they're going, if you see
someone sleeping in a park, you say 'hey, I've got a spare room, you
can come stay with me', or whatever.  And people don't want to do
that.  If they see a beggar, they keep driving, they choose leaders
that always tell us not to pick up hitchhikers, the guy in the park,
well, that's what the homeless shelter is for."

"But isn't it dangerous to pick up hitchhikers?"

"Yeah", Andrea replied, sucking in her breath, "picking up hitckhikers
is dangerous.  But we remember the story of the good samartain, we
remember that we're called to love our neighbors, and we don't let one
bad experience turn us against all hitchhikers."  She uttered the last
phrase as though a robot, it was her voice, she was preaching to
herself, but she didn't really beleive it.

"It's more dangerous not to pick them up.  It's dangerous because then
we're violating the commandments that Christ gave us to live by; we're
acting out of fear and not love.  And the reason someone, well a lot
of people, actually, like Captain Mercurio, really dislike democracy
is because people don't choose leaders who say, look, you should stop
and pick these people up, they choose leaders who say, no, don't do
that, think of how dangerous it is, put your own safety first."

"You mentioned homeless shelters, in a somewhat negative way.  Do you
not support homeless shelters?"

"Well, I've been a few, many years ago, before I had a steady job
with NASA.  The problem with homeless shelters is that people think
because there's a homeless shelter, well, the problem's taken care
of, they don't have to do anything, but again, Christ tells us that
we should..."

"But can't people take advantage of that?  I mean, won't some people
just take and take and take without working or really doing anything
productive?"

"Sure, a lot of people will, in a lot of different ways.  Christianity
is about being taken advantage of, when you love unconditionally, when
you give unconditionally, when you forgive unconditionally, people
will just take and take and take, and most people, understandably,
don't want that, and that's why they really don't live as Christians.
They give up to a point and then they say no more.  But one of
Christ's stories was about a woman who came to the temple in Jerusalem
to give a donation.  There were all these other people who gave all
these big donations, and this old woman gave just two bits.  Jesus
told his diciples that she went away redeemed rather than the others,
because she had given all she had, while the others had just given
their surplus.  So it's not about how much you give, it's about you're
willingness to give all."

"Well, that raises a good point, that's been made by people like
Warren Buffett.  I mean, can't you do a lot more good in the world by
working hard, so then you'll have the money to spend on charities that
can really make a difference?"

"Well, now we come back to the first commandment, the one about loving
God.  The point isn't to do as much good as we can in the world, the
point is to live in harmony with God.  That's really what's going on
here, ultimately we're all spiritual beings, first and foremost, so
how much good we can do in the world is really secondary if we're not
living in harmony with God, so that's why the woman who just gives a
little goes away redeemed, because she's the one who's living in
harmony with God."

"What does it mean to live in harmony with God, how do we do that?"

"That's what Christ taught us.  That's what his Gospel teachings are
all about.  I mean, Christ could have chosen to be a political leader,
he was tempted to do that by the Devil, he could have liberated the
Jewish people from the Roman Empire, heck, he could have become the
Roman Emperor, he could have freed the slaves two thousand years ago,
he could have done a lot more 'good' in the world if he'd been
tougher.  But what he was trying to teach us is that living in harmony
with God, loving God, loving each other as sons and daughters of God,
is more important that all the 'good' you do."

"I don't think I understand, completely.  Isn't the 'good' we do, I
mean, isn't that what living in harmony with God is about?"

"No, not really, it's just an effect.  Christ taught us that faith in
God is the most important thing, and that our works come from our
faith.  Our good deads, our works, they are the outward expression of
our inward faith, but it's the faith that's the most important thing.
So you can do all kind of good works, but if the faith isn't there, it
doesn't amount for much.  On the other hand, if you have faith, then
it will be expressed in your works, because you'll always be looking
for ways to help people, to give to people, to forgive people, because
you love people, or at least try to.  I guess it's kinda like what
Marc, what Captain Mercurio did to defraud his investors, he created
some kind of robot that could cook dinner, but it didn't work the way
he said, because it actually had a person operating it.  Good works
are like that, it's not the outward appearance that's important, it's
what's going on behind the scenes."

"What do you think of the Christian right?"

"Well, the Christian right seems to be much more a political movement
than a spiritual one.  We hear constantly from them about sex.  Sex,
sex, sex, sex, sex.  Yet they're almost completely silent on something
like Capitalism.  Chirst say 'give to all those who beg of you'.  He
told one of his followers to sell all his worldly possesions and give
the money to the poor.  Go ahead - try it.  Sell all your worldly
possessions, give the money to the poor, and see how people treat you
then.  The Christian right has almost nothing to say about this.  They
rail about sex, but are strangely silent about the neighborhood
merchant who puts a price tag on everything in his store and is
standing there behind the cash register to take your money before you
walk out the door.  And then you look at what they really propose.  So
much of it involves more and more government regulation.  They want
the government to ban abortions.  Look, I don't support abortion, but
having the government 'get tough' with abortion clinics isn't the
answer.  They're tough on crime.  Fine.  Christ said love your
enemies.  Why don't you see them agitating for decent treatment of
prisoners in jails?"

"You mentioned the treatment of prisoners.  The United States,
in particular, has all manner of regulations designed to ensure
humane treatment of prisoners.  How are they inadequate?"

"Well, I've never spent more than a night in jail, but if you look at
the videotapes of how prisons are run, they look to me like military
boot camps.  The prisoners are told when to get up, marched through
dining halls, assigned to work projects, ordered here and there.
Maybe more significantly, the prisons are seen as something between a
threat and a punishment.  They're there to create fear in people; you
obey the laws or else you go to jail.  In my mind, just about the only
reason to imprison someone is because they're dangerous to other
people and need to be isolated.  And once they've been isolated,
there's no reason to go beyond that.  Just give them an apartment in a
guarded complex, the level of security being dependent on how
dangerous they are.  What rational reason is there for anything else?
So much of how our prisons are run is based on anger and hatred.
People don't love their enemies; they hate them, and they want to make
them suffer, so that's why they want their prisons to be 'tough'."

"OK, we've only got a few minutes left, let me change the subject, at
least slightly.  You're a scientist, or at least an engineer, so what
do you say to people who claim that there's no scientific proof from
the existance of God, so it must be just a myth?"

"You know, I was asked that question many years ago, and at the time I
couldn't really answer it, but I thought about for a while and here's
my answer: Scientific proof is based on experiment.  There is an
experiment you can perform to find out if God is real - you can die.
Most of us don't want to perform that experiment just to satisfy our
curiosity about God, but the fact remains that we will all die some
day, and then you'll know.  So my answer to those people is just to
wait - you're going to find out all about God some day."

"Well, thank you for joining us this evening.  My guest had been
Dr. Andrea Yeats, astronaut and Christian.  We'll be back in a minute
with my final thought."

The entire crew had watched the broadcast, floating on the other
side of the TV camera.  After the program ended, they were
fairly quiet for a while, the captain in particular.

"You did really good, I was quite proud of you," he finally said.

Andrea's television interview aired four days later, to a large
audience.  It provoked widespread public response, evidenced by a
deluge of e-mails whose subject lines ranged the spectrum from "May
God bless you and your crew" and "Thank you, you are a genuine saint"
to "Christianity COMMANDS Capitalism" and "This is __HERESY__!!!".

"All the cargo modules are in place, we're still taking meteor hits
in the forward compartments, but they're the empty fuel tanks."

"The wings are still vulnerable," Andrea pointed out.  "The 'meteor
wake' of the cargo modules covers us here, and the body of the 747,
but it doesn't cover the wings."  Burns was nodding.  The Captain
listened, and said nothing.  The entire crew was silent for about
10 seconds.

"Can I say something?" Alister asked.

"Sure," Mercuriou answered, "that's what I'm waiting for, anybody to
talk.  Say whatever you want."

"Well," Alister said after clearing his through, "if we move out of
LEO, I mean, that's what we're taking about, right?"  Again there were
nods around the cabin.  "That puts us out of range of the space
shuttle!?"  Alister voice trailed off at the end.  The last two
weeks had passed in a sureal blur.  He still found it
fantastic that he was actually flying in space, and now the commander
actually wanted to move beyond range of the _space_shuttle_?!

"That's a real good point," Andrea said gravely.  "Look, you've made
your point," she spoke now directly to Mercirou.  "Let's start looking
at re-entry scenarios.  We've got to test this craft..."  The Captain
was ephastically shaking his head, no, No, NO!

"We're going to Mars, Dr. Yeats, that's not going to change."

"Fine, you can go to Mars," Merceriou started to interrupt but Yeats
would not let him, "but first you've got to test this spacecraft in
a controlled environment where we've got rescue options both in
space and on the ground."

Again there was silence, but a deeper, tenser one.

"She's got a good point, Marc," Burns concluded.

Merceriou guffawled.

"You going turn traitor on me now, Burns?" he asked with a snicker
in his voice.

Burns answered with a laugh in his.

"Hey, you're the boss, but I'm just saying what she says makes a lot
of sense."

"We could contact a neutral country," Andrea continued to argue,
calmly, clearly.  "Switzerland might let us land."

Again there was a silence of several seconds, but this time Mercuriou
broke it.

"Take us out of LEO."

"OMS-7 in five, four, three, two, one, ignition..."  Alister called
off the countdown from the copilot's seat.  The 747 had been undocked
from the cargo modules and then redocked to them using a special
fiting on its nose.  The rocket engines of the 747 now pushed the
cargo modules from behind.  A change of computer software now used the
cargo modules' maneuvering thrusters to maintain proper attitude
during the burn.

"We still haven't decided on a name for the ship," Marc explained.

"Well, can I put my two cents in?"  "Sure"

"You've heard the story of Icarus?"

"Some greek hero, right?"  Mercurio replied, vaguely enough to betry
his failure to exactly place the name.

"The son of Daedalus.  The father built wax wings for them both
to escape prison, and Icarus flew too close to the sun, and his wings
melted," Brian interjected.

"That's right," Andrea afirmed, and a moment's silence fell on the group
before people started to chuckle.  Burns finally bust laughing out loud.
Mercurio smiled, and noted quietly that his crew had learned to laugh
at the insanity of their undertaking.


Two days later, the _Icarus_ breaks orbit.  Mercurio moves the ship to a
six-hour orbit, basically solves the meteor problem this way, and the
crew gets to work.  They've brought supplies for a year before the
crops have to work.


T + 91 days

After three months in orbit, the constant TV interviews had died down
and the _Icarus_ crew had settled into a kind of routine.  This day was
typical.  Burns led Alister into the branching tree of docked cargo
modules, rummaged in one for a moment or two, then pulled out the
box he was looking for, a brand-new Whirlpool automatic dishwasher.

"Will this work in orbit?" he asked.  Alister shrugged non-commitally.

"Find out," Burns said as he pushed the box towards the open hatch,
letting Alister slow its momentum and guide it into the docking nexus
before propelling it down towards the main body of the spacecraft.
While Alister starting pulling apart the styrofoam packing pieces,
Burns returned to organizing the various equipment that now filled the
cramped crew compartment.  The captain quickly joined in.

"Where do you want it?" he asked his chief engineer, taking a box of
reference books that Burns had pulled out for his last big project,
modifying the forward radar array to give better azimuth coverage.

"Put them back in L-9; you should find some space there," Burns
replied, refering to the cargo module into which he had moved
most of the books he had brought.  He had wanted to scan them
electronically, but as the time-fuel trade-off had shifted
towards burning fuel to save time, the scanning had been
postponed and the books stored into cargo modules.

Meanwhile, the South African had begun removing the cover from the
bulky dishwasher.  Having examined its construction, he had already
concluded that it would just fill up with water and spill over into
the cabin when opened, so his first thought was to install a vacuum
suction to remove the water when the machine was finished.  Having
done so, he found that the device depended on gravity to pull the
water down into a catch basin from where it was recycled.  Try
as he might, he couldn't figure a way to draw the water back
down for recycling.  It would just form into drops and float
around in the machine until he opened the door and vacuumed it out.
After an hour or so of fiddling, Burns came over and they spent
another half hour working on it together before finally giving up.
Since they didn't use plates or utensils in space, it wasn't that
important a device, so Alister put it back into storage and went
on to the next item on the list - a small refrigerator, of which
Burns had packed a dozen.  It worked flawlessly, and Alister
spent the remainder of the day installing the refrigerators
all over the ship.


T + 100 days

By now, the ship had assumed a stable configuration.  The 747's
crowded crew compartment was the hub of activity, with the remainder
of the ship docked to its upward-facing airlock.  The first module,
docked directly to the 747, had become basically an extension of the
aircraft, where the crew tended to take their meals and gather for
all-hands briefings.  Past the first module was a docking nexus, with
four modules extending out from its sides, and other module mated
above.  These four modules had become the crew quarters.  Bryan and
Burns shared one, Vic and Alister another.  Andrea, as the only woman
aboard, had an entire module all to herself, as did the Captain.
Next came Module 2, primarilly used for storage of immediately
needed items, such as a supply of food rations, with enough
open space in the middle to allow easy passage to the next docking
nexus, with four more modules faning out from it.  Two were basically
engineering workshops, packed with a variety of tools Burns had
brought up from Earth, a third Vic had converted into the ship's
sick bay, and the fourth was a library, loaded mainly with
Burns' various technical books.

Beyond the second module, the side modules were taken up with a mix of
greenhouse modules, of which there were twelve, and storage modules,
containing both supplies carried from Earth and the crew's refuse and
waste, which the Captain and Burns had forbid throwing overboard.
Though it would be some time before they figured how to convert their
waste into fertilizer for the plants, they knew that everything had to
be recycled if they were to make it to the red planet and back.

Past the greenhouse modules were the tank modules of fuel, oxidizer,
and water, attached to the sides of more docking nexuses,
interconnected by storage modules so packed with supplies that it was
almost impossible to move through them.  The crew hardly ever ventured
that far into the spaceship, having organized all of their valuable
supplies close to the 747 and relegated things like the dishwasher to
the more distant modules.  In all, there were 14 modules arranged in a
line, with 13 docking nexuses interconnecting them and with another 52
modules attached to the various docking ports.

They still had about a dozen of the rocket engines from the cargo
modules' second stages, attached, with their fuel tanks, to the ends
of the side modules jutting out from the docking nexuses.  Under
Burns' direction, three of the cargo modules were converted to act as
Orbital Transfer Vehicles, which could hold two or three people,
maneuver, and fire their single rocket engines.


T + 113 days

Mercuriou had banned smoking in A-core, which had by now been
designated _Icarus_' bridge, so Burns now spent several hours a day in
B-core with a laptop computer propped against his crossed knee and a
marijuana joint in his left hand.  By the time Andrea opened the
pressure door and propelled herself in, the joint had burnt out and
was floating a meter above Burns' head.  The arid smell of marijuana
smoke hung in the air, not yet cleared out by the charcoal filters
humming in the background.

"Burns," Andrea started to say, but the ship's chief engineer put a
finger to his lips.  He was wearing one of his favorite T-shirts,
solid black except for a single word across the front, in neon-green
letters formed from a series of wide horizontal lines, like you might
see on a TV screen: MUTE.

[This T-shirt is original.  I've never seen one as described.]

Andrea waited, irate.  It disturbed her that Burns worked on critical
software while intoxicated.  Finally he saved what he was working on,
pushed the laptop away, and looked up.

"Dr. Andrea Yeats," declared he, reveling in the the drug-induced haze.

Fastened to a sofa chair by a restraining strap, the NASA engineer watched
the laptop drift away from Burns, collide with a cushion he had aimed
it for, and rebound gently before coming to a halt.

"You all work stoned?" she asked.

"Not always, but right now a lot."

"Try every day."

Burns shrugged.

"I don't work stoned, why do you need to work stoned."

"Because I'm bored."

"Bored?"

"Yes, this work is boring.  When I'm bored, it's easier to work
stoned.  After a while, it catches up with you, and you can't get
anything done because you're just so sick of looking at it, sober _or_
stoned.  That's the problem with being smart.  The smarter you get,
the more you can do, and the fewer other people there are who can help
do it.  Eventually, you get so smart that you can do almost anything,
and nothing actually gets done."

Andrea paused for a minute to think about this.

"What are you working on?" she finally asked.

"I'm running landing simulations for Mars, for about the
million-and-oneth time.  I'm going over the payload manifest _again_,
and trust me I've already gone over it sober several times, too.  I'm
looking at failure modes _again_ on a re-orbit attempt."

"Well, maybe I can help you out."

"Be my guest!" the one engineer exclaimed and motioned the other
towards the laptop.  Andrea didn't move.  Burns slowly started
laughing.

"Don't worry, doctor, I won't let you do all the work," he drawled
with the air of man who'd just maneuvered his way out of an unpleasant
task.  "You didn't come in here for that."

"Actaully, I wanted to ask you about the captain.  You've known him
a long time?"

Burns nodded.  "Since college," he replied.  "We'd roomed together
since our freshman year.  I met him looking for a place to live, and
both of us for the same reason.  We'd been admitted to the university
but didn't apply for housing until that deadline had passed.  We ended
up answering an ad from this medical student named Vic Antonov," he
laughed.  "We had a lot of great parties."

"What was he like?"

"The captain?"  Burns was quiet for a minute.  "He's a lot different
now than he was in college.  Back then, all he wanted was a joint, a
beer and a Latin dictionary and he was happy.  Now, he's a lot more...
driven," he concluded with a shrug.

"How did he get 'driven'?"

"I guess he did what he had to do to get by."

"He had to steal a billion dollars?"

"If he wanted to fly to Mars, he did," Burns replied quickly, then
slowed his speech.  "He learned to be tough, I guess."  Burns now
paused completely for a moment.  "The kid I knew in college wouldn't
have got us here... of course, the kid I _was_ in college wouldn't
have got here, either!"

Andrea was silent, then finally blurted out the question she had
been struggling to answer since almost their first day in orbit.

"Why did you agree to this?"

Burns stretched out and started laughing.  "Because I wanted to go to
Mars!"  he finally exclaimed.  "What did you say when he asked you -
'let me think about it for a few days'?"

Andrea smiled.  The reasons weren't so different after all.  At the
time of the launch, events had happened so quickly that she hadn't
really thought through what Mercurio was proposing or what she had
accepted / gotten into.  All she had seen was an opportunity to fly
into space and the simple justification that there were some people
who seemed like they could use her help.  In fact, she
had almost assumed that they would quickly need her help to get back
home.  In truth / fact, she was amazed by how little real help they
had needed, and over time had developed a deep respect for the ship's
chief engineer.  Its captain she was still trying to figure out / Its
captain was still a mystery to her.

"So, why is Mercurio captain and not you?" she now bluntly asked.

Burns thought for a minute.

"Well, it was his idea to fly to Mars, not mine.  And I don't want
to be captain, not really.  But there's more to it than that."

Patiently, Andrea waited in silence until Burns went on.

"Marc and I always got along well in college.  I could explain pretty
much all the math stuff anybody was studying and he, for his part,
could understand it.  On the other hand, he had some great ideas, and
one of the best was his Greek reading tool, and could really help him
with all the technical details.  And I found out something later on -
he can lead, he can manage, whatever you want to call it."

"Every job I had after college, I was either overwealmed with work, or
bored out my mind.  Usually both at the same time.  I made a better
team with my college roommate than with any of those dot-coms, and
mainly because Marc only asked me to do a little.  He got two other
comp-sci students to do most of the programming on this thing; I just
had to design it, and could code or not code whatever part I felt like."

"When Marc proposed this thing, it seemed ambitious as hell, but he
knows how to get things done.  He asked me what I needed from him, and
he told me what he needed from me.  He's done a really good job of
making sure I don't get overwealmed.  Even though this thing is so
big, it's almost the easiest thing I've ever done.  A lot easier than
some really simplier projects where I just didn't get the things I
needed to get them done.  I've just planned it out, showed/explained
all the plans to Marc, and he's figured out how to get someone else to
do 90% of it, and you better believe that a big part of that was
figuring out how steal a billion dollars.  I just do about 10% of the
work, and _usually_ the most interesting part anyway... but not
today," he concluded with a sigh.

#if HUMPH

"What do you mean, can you give me an example?" Andrea asked.

"Well, consider when we developed that fuel for NASA.  I told Marc we
could really use a new fuel, and that programs like _Gaussian_ might
let us design one, but you know I didn't (have to) write a single line
of code?  Oh, I had to do the router hack so we get some money to get
started, but then he just hired a bunch of programmers, bought the
software, sat me down with them to explain what we needed, and they
went and did all the mundane stuff.  And then he hired a bunch of
chemists to test it out, and got them to equip a chem lab.  I could do
as much or as little as the testing as I wanted.  And then he hired a
bunch of chemical engineers to design the manufacturing plant.  After
I designed the rocket engines, he hired a bunch of Mexicans to
actually run the factory to build them, and made sure they were smart
Mexicans, not just a bunch of guys who would slap something together
half-ass.  When it was time to equip the mission, I just came up with
a list of things we needed, and he went and got almost all of them.
And still understood everything enough to come back and ask me, well,
shouldn't we take pure strains of these crops in case the hybrids
don't grow well in space?  That's Marc.  He's the best boss I've ever
worked for, and a good friend, too."

#endif

"What do think of his politics?"

Burns shrugged.  "Who knows?  If you ask him straight up, he'll admit
that it's just his opinion and he might be wrong.  He's got one thing
right - most of the work we do is bullshit.  Who wants to write
another stupid routing protocol?  Hell, if we're going to do
something, fuck it, let's fly to Mars!"

"What are you, some kind of reporter now?  You gonna go around this
ship trying to draw everybody's life history out of them?"

Vic was peering at a television camera relaying an image from B-13,
one of the hydroponic pods.  He did a lot of work remotely, partly
because it avoiding having to go all the way down the cargo chain just
to do a transplant, partly because the robotics software Alister had
stolen from the Japanese enabled a lot of the work to be automated
anyway, and partly because his experience with hydroponics taught him
to keep all the pods sealed, to contain any fungal or virual outbreak
to a single pod.  Today, he was training a neural net to pick cherry
tomatoes with a robot hand.

Andrea thought for a moment before answering his question.

"I'm no reporter, but I usually have the opportunity to get to know a
crew before we're blasted into orbit together.  I've already spent
more time in space with you guys than with any other astronauts, and I
barely know anything about you!  Take your medical degree, for
example, I mean why aren't you using it?  Sounds to me like until this
gig came along, you were just siting up in the hills growing pot."

The doctor sighed as he put the blood pack into the refrigerator,
closed the door, and latched it shut.  Turning, he kept his hands
behind his back, holding on to the refrigerator door as he faced the
woman from NASA.

"I went to medicial school because I wanted to help people; learn to
heal their injuries, ease their pain, that kind of thing.  Mainly what
you learn is how to look things up in a book, recommend expensive
procedures done by for-profit companies just across the street from
your for-profit hospital, scribble out prescriptions for pricy
medicines, and pay your medical school loans.  And you know what the
worst thing was?  I thought medical school would be full of idealistic
young men and women determined to advance the frontiers of an age-old
and honorable profession.  Instead, most of my classmates just wanted
to know what on the next test so they could pass their class, get
their degree, and move on to the next step towards their
million-dollar beach house."

"Please grip about socialized medicine," the doctor continued, warming
to his subject and growing increasingly agitated as his talked.
"Hell, our medicine already is socialized; it's just capitalist
socialism instead of communist socialism.  Doctors don't make the
decisions; H.M.O.s and Medicare and hospital administrators and
pharmasutecal companies do.  The bottom line is still the same.  It's
still some screwed up system that everyone is a little cog in.  Sure,
you can buck the system.  But just like John Cougar Mellancamp said,
'whenever I fight the system, the system always wins'.  You fight the
system, nobody'll hire you because you won't churn out the billable
hours, you very well may lose your hospital privileges 'cause you
don't have some 'group' you're part of, if you just ask people to pay
what they can afford, you'll get a pittance, and on top of it all
you'll still have medical school loans to pay off, and they're
astronomical because the medical schools expect that you'll do like
everybody else and make a killing, so they want a nice little piece of
the pie, too."

"And as far as sitting up in the hills growing pot," he concluded, "it
happens to be something I'm really good at, it beats sitting in some
stuffy office building, and looks like it just might get us to Mars!"

"You wouldn't have been using any alcohol or illegal drugs, would you?"

"No," Andrea replied, stiffling the anger she felt at the policeman's
leading question, "I haven't."  She was in Germany for a technical
conference, and been pulled over in her rental car after turning the
wrong way down a one-way street.  If the sign had been in German, she
probably would have understood it, but it was one of those idiotic
"international" pictograms with just a red circle and line.  So now
she was pulled over the side, parked behind a ludicrously small police
car with its funny sounding siren, being questioned by a German
policeman.

"Then how did I get into the driver's seat of your car?" he asked.

The anger vanished, and fear gripped Andrea, terrifying, unreasoning
fear.  How had he gotten into the driver's seat?  He sat there in the
car seat next to her, but somehow she was on the passenger's side.
She opened her month and started to stammer something, then caught the
policeman's eyes as they narrowed and a lewd smile crept onto his
face.  Oh my God, it's him.  Oh my God, not again, she thought as his
hand slid across towards her leg.  She couldn't move, couldn't breath,
couldn't talk, couldn't scream, couldn't do anything but sit terrified
as he moved to touch her... and woke up.

Meanwhile, the first crops from the ship's vegetable garden ripened,
just as the supply of military rations was growing noticably short.
Vic set about devising a high-protein diet plan, and soy beans, which
had grown quite readily in zero-g, topped his list.  The doctor
prepared his first batch in the Burns-devised vegetable steamer, which
superheated a pressurized canister of water before releasing it into
the chamber containing the soy beans.  As it left the canister, the
water, already heated beyond its conventional boiling point, burst
into steam with a loud hizzing that attracted the attention of the
young South African in the next module.

"Soy beans?" Alister questioned, imagining the pressed blocks of
tofu he had habitually passed by in the supermarket.

"I rather like them steamed," Vic replied.

"I don't know about this, mate," the programmer quibbled as he
inspected some of the freshly picked raw beans.  "I'll eat them,
though," he quickly added.

"Ever been to a sushi restaurant?" Vic asked, with a raised eyebrow
that indicated he thought he knew something his friend didn't.

"Sure, I love sushi, it's great!  Got any tuna hand roll in there?"

"Nope, but you ever had those green beans they serve as appetizers?"

"Yeah," Alister replied, glancing back down at the soy pods in his
hand.  "That's what these are?"

The doctor nodded affirmatively as he opened the steamer and let some
of the cooked soy beans, along with an ample quantity of steam, float
out into the air.  The aroma of freshly steamed vegatables permeated
the air and quickly brought work to a standstill on a spaceship where
plastic-wrapped spaghetti pouches and freeze dried peaches had been
the norm for months.

"What have we got here?" the captain asked as he floated in with Burns
from one direction, almost simultaneously as Andrea entered from a
side module, where she had been calibrating instrumentation for an
upcoming survey run.

"Are these from the garden?" she asked.  "Great!"

They had made it back to Earth without incident.  Crouds, cheering,
parties, Andrea vaquely remembered them.  She had settled back into
life as a NASA engineer, and after the initial round of publicity
wore off, back into some kind of routine.  The chance to go to Tokyo
for a conference came up, and she jumped at it.  She was the keynote
speaker, all the media wanted to interview her, and best of all a lot
of people just didn't recognize her as she walked around downtown.
Those who did were invariably polite.  She came back to her hotel
after a wonderful sushi dinner, and was gazing out from her window
at the city below.  Then the door was thrown open, she turned around,
and gasped in fear.

"Think I'd forgotten about you?"  He stood silohited in the lighted
frame of the door as he walked into the dark room.  Her heart leaped
with fear and her feet were frozen to the ground.  She couldn't
move; couldn't scream... but yelled as she woke up.

Burns had begun preparing for a Mars attempt at this point.  He needed
cargo modules on the ground to resupply the 747 after it had been
landed, and he needed rockets to put them there.  He avoided using the
re-entry method favored by NASA, of building a heatshield and letting
the atmosphere burn off your velocity, partly because he didn't want
to deal with the technical issues, partly because he didn't have to,
since his fuel was so much more efficient, and partly because of Vic's
constant harping about the environmental effects of the space shuttle
buring a hole through the ozone layer.

What _was_ required was to take the rest of the engines out of the
cargo modules and mount them to fuel modules to build more OTVs.
Then they were docked to cargo modules, but this could be
done remotely.  More EVAs, like the first in Earth orbit,
we required to mount the engines to the fuel modules.

Burns and Alister were now in the midst of their twenty-third such
EVA.  They were working well away from the cargo chain,
having first moved there the cargo modules they were working
on before openning the modules containing stored engines.
They were working on their last engine installation of the day,
with two completed, but empty, OTVs nearby.

"OK, ease her in further."

Since the Icarus was close enough to avoid any noticable radio lag,
the Captain was controlling the module from the ship while the two men
floated near it in spacesuits.  In fact, he was several hundred
kilometers away.  Vic sailed into the bridge, grabbed for a handhold,
missed, and hit the Captain's arm just as he tapped the a joystick to
fire the maneuvering thrusters.  They fired at nearly ten times the
strength he had intended, in a bizarre direction that sent the module
crashing sideways into one of the completed ones, with Alister in the
middle.  He pushed away from the errant module, but couldn't move fast
enough to keep his arm from being crushed between the two modules.
The bone snapped in two and Alister hollered in pain.

"Shit," the Captain said, hitting the control in the opposite
direction, and awkwardly easied the cargo module away.  Alister began
screaming and floated free, except for his teather.  Burns cut his own
teather, fire his suit thrusters, and zipped over to his friend, whose
was in agony.  His spacesuit was leaking air, as well.

"Get him into the airlock!" the Captain ordered, but Burns yelled
back,

"He'll never make it!"

The fracture was compound and the broken bone had ripped a hole in the
suit.  Air was pouring out, propelling the young man in crazy
directions as he turned from one side to another and bounced on the
end of the teather.

"Quit waving your arms!"  Burns yelled.

He now had firm grasp of the young man and made a quick decision.
Without saying another word, he shoved the bone back into the suit,
pulled apart the two sections of bone, and tried to snap them back
together somehow.  Alister freaked, screaming in pain, but the bone
went back in the spacesuit and Burns clamped his hand over the hole.

"Hold still!" Burns yelled again.

"You fucking hold still, you crazy Yank!  Oh my bloody hell!"

"Here, hold your other hand over the hole!"

Back on _Icarus_, the Captain quickly brushed off Vic's stumble
as an accident, and the doctor thankfully was able to forget
about it as he raced to his sick bay and starting assembling
anything he thought he'd need.  Andrea Yeats, without asking,
went to one of the other modified cargo modules and flipped
on its com system.

"I'm powering OTV 3."

"OK, Vic, Andrea's powering three."

"Got it", answered the doctor, as he pulled out of the sick bay
refrigerator the two pints of blood he had taken from Alister
earlier in the trip, along with two pints of the Captain's
matching O Positive.

"I'll need a refrigerator in the OTV," he noted into his microphone.

"I'm on it," Bryan said, heading into the crew quarters to throw
all the food out of one of the mini-fridges.

Meanwhile, Burns got Alister back into the pressurized safety of the
OTV, but he had lost a lot of blood and was now unconscious.  Vic told
him to touranquit the wound, but had serious doubt that the Alister
would live for the day it would take them to manuerver through the
asteroids with the preasuse blood.  He shared his concerns privately
with Andrea as she released the hydraulic moaring clamps and backed
the OTV away from the _Icarus_ docking port.

Turning the OTV towards the asteroid belt, she engaged its main engine
and let it burn.  She kept it on far beyond the point where she could
stop the ship before reaching the first asteroids.

"What are you doing?" the Captain asked from the bridge, watching her
speed continue to increase on the computer-generated plan position
display in front of him.

"Every play _Asteroids_?" she asked.

Over the next half hour, she caroomed through the asteroid belt at
breakneck speed, never stopping the vehicle and often making long
burns on the main engine, twice coming within a hundred meters of an
asteroid, pivoting the nimble little ship around between burns to
dodge first this asteroid then another as they came into her radar's
field of vision.  She began a series of slowdown burns about ten
minutes from the construction asteroid, finally docking with the other
OTV only an hour and three minutes after the accident.

"Can we go back the normal way?" Vic asked dryly as they unstrapped
from their seats.  The doctor's fingers were white from where they had
been grasping the seat.

The NASA engineer's fancy flying had probably saved Alister's life.
After stabilizing his condition, Vic declared there was no rush to get
him back to the _Icarus_, since he had brought all the medical
supplies he needed with him.  Andrea and Burns tried to complete the
assembly work, but found that one of the two damaged modules was
simply incapable of holding pressure in its plumbing, so they took
both with them and piloted the two OTVs back to _Icarus_ - the normal
way.  At a crew meeting two days later, held around Alister's sick bed
with his arm in a cast, Andrea was unanimously selected first officer.

Back on Earth, the dramatic rescue of the young astronaut drew popular
attention once again to the space mission.  The _Icarus_ was almost
completely on the other side of the solar system, and radio communications
with Earth were being relayed through a communications satellite
Burns had launched into solar orbit just before leaving Earth.
The end result was a half-hour time lag in communications that left
both NASA and the rest of the planet as passive observers of the
dramatic video footage relayed to them.

Andrea Yeats' role in the rescue and subsequent elevation to first
officer afforded her celebrity status.  A weekly American TV
newsmagazine decided to interview her.  The hour-long round trip radio
lag between Earth and the _Icarus_ dictated an unusual format for the
interview.  Conducted in several sessions spread over two days, it
consisted of a series of videotaped questions transmitted to the space
craft.  After viewing each question, Andrea then dictated a response,
which might later trigger followup questions.  The TV producers then
edited the material into a coherent interview, with relatively few
questions and relatively long responses.  An entire broadcast episode
was deveoted to the interview.

Dr. Antonov decided that confinement to bed was largely pointless in
zero-gee, so he allowed Alister to move around the ship in his brace,
to which Burns attached plastic guards that Alister called his
"bumpers".  The ship was running smoothly, and with the stress of the
initial months behind them, the crew of the _Icarus_ had settled into
a leisurely routine.  Captain Mercuriou was slowly rereading
Plutarch's _Lives_of_the_Nobel_Gretians_and_Romans_, this time in the
original Latin; Vic undertook a careful breeding program to develop
strains of important food crops (and marijuana) specifically adapted
for growth in zero-gee; Burns and Andrea were working on their mission
plan for a Mars landing; and Alister was learning to play the guitar
during his convelecance.

"Hmmph!" Marc verbalized this particular evening while everyone was
gathered in the 747's main compartment.  He was reading from a
detached LCD panel while Alister practiced his scales, Burns and
Andrea worked on some computer program, and Vic was listening to a
rock album on headphones in the light haze of a marijuana joint he had
recently passed around.

"Sparta must have been an amazing place to live," the Captain
speculated, as Vic removed his headphones.  "You have to wonder if
Marx knew anything of its history.  I don't know, but Sparta has to be
one of the greatest socialist success stories ever."

"Were they Communists?" Alister asked, setting aside his instrument
and shaking his left hand.

"Not exactly," Marc replied.  "Or maybe they were, depending on how
you look at it.  The parents didn't raise their children, for example,
the children were raised by the state.  And their 'education', if you
can call it that, consisted of leaving them to starve unless they
could steal food to eat."

"That sounds insane!?" the youth replied.  "Why on Earth wouldn't they
feed their own children?"

"Lycurgus wanted a nation of warriors... and he got it."

"The determination of mankind to train their children to hate and kill
_is_ amazing," Andrea interjected.

"Well, maybe you can be our twentieth-first-century Lycurgus, Doctor,"
Marc speculated with a mischevious grin, as Vic began to chuckle.
"Maybe you can prescribe a set of rules for us to raise our children
to be Christians instead of warriors."

"I think Jesus already gave us those rules far better than I could."

"The problem is that people don't live by those rules," Vic noted.
"They talk about them all the time, but mostly it's just talk."

"I don't know about that," the Captain retorted.  "William Gibson
thought that Christianity was a major factor in the destruction of the
Roman Empire.  At first the Romans were Pagans, they gloried in the
martial arts, taught their children the virtues of war, worshiped gods
like Mars and Jupiter.  Then came along the Christians, everybody
started turning the other cheek and forgiving their enemies, before
long, no more Roman Empire."

"Yes," Vic answered, "but a large part of Christianity was all about
propping up the Roman Empire, and then the Popes, and all the monarchs
who got their scepters from the Popes.  Christianity certainly got
bastardized in the process."

"Hmmm," Marc replied thoughtfully, "yes, a large part of any religion
is about propping up the existing social order."

"What amazes me about Western civilization is this notion that the
individual somehow owes something to the state, or at least to the
society.  This modern morality that people have some kind of
obligation to work.  That's gotten embedded into the religion along
with all this other stuff that justifies the government.  I guess it's
all part of propping up the society."

"But people have to work to live, right?"  Alister wondered.  "I mean,
people have always had to eat, right?"

"Yes and no," the doctor replied.  "Yes, people have always had to
work to eat, but this notion that people have to work
_for_the_society_ is what I'm talking about.  Take the Native American
Indians, for example.  They taught their children from a young age to
build fires by rubbing sticks together, to recognize wild plants as
edible or poisonous, to build a shelter or a bow and arrow just from
the natural materials you'd find lying about in a forest.  The net
result was that by the time they were fifteen years old, they could
literally walk out into the forest and take care of themselves.  Their
society, therefore, was perfectly voluntary.  If anyone didn't want to
be there, they could just get up and leave.  Murders, armed robberies,
the violent crimes that we're so familiar with, were almost unknown.
I think it was because they raised their children to be truly
independent, while Western society for generations has raised people
to be dependant.  Most people wouldn't have the slightest idea how to
feed themselves if they couldn't walk into the supermarket with a
twenty dollar bill in their hands.  Thus, the individual is raised to
work for the society, and the society has taught the individual that
they are morally obligated to work.  Inevitably, this morality has
worked its way into the religion as well."

"And the philosophers keep talking about freedom," Marc added, "but
how can you have freedom in a world where everyone is raised to
be dependent on everyone else?"

"Exactly."

"So the philosophers have turned to politics to try and find freedom
there.  Their latest idea is democracy; they keep trying to convince
us that freedom is to be found in that dumb vote, and don't you dare
try to tell these people they don't have freedom, they'll scream you
down as a Communist and all the while they're surrounded by a society
based on nothing but forced labor."

"Christianity isn't based on forced labor," Andrea noted after a pause.

"Could have fooled me."

"You need to distinguish true Christianity from, how did Vic put it,
bastardized Christianity?"

The ship's doctor nodded in assent.

"Jesus didn't teach us to work to eat, in fact, just the opposite.  He
taught us not to worry about food, or clothing, or housing.  He said
to put your faith in God for those things.  He pointed out that the
birds in the air don't sow the field, or reap the harvest, yet God
provides them with all the seed they need to survive.  Jesus taught us
to put God first, love and generosity second, and let your faith take
care of the rest."

"That sounds good, Andrea," Marc slowly replied, "but faith in God
didn't get any of us here.  None of the companies that sold us this
equipment did it for love or generosity.  They did it because they
thought they would get something out of it for themselves.  We got
here because we were willing to take it from them."

"That's funny, 'cause I didn't take anything from anyone.  Faith in
God got _me_ here."

"Look we've made it this far without any serious problems."

"Yeah, but all the really critical stuff's been well tested up until
now.  Think about it.  We test-fired all the rocket engines before
using any of them.  We burned extra fuel to keep the aerodynamic
stresses on the 747 within its normal flight tolerances.  We
brought spare fuel canisters in case the supply tanks didn't
work."

"And we didn't really need any of those things.  Look, the
bottom line is that we said we were going to Mars, and now
we're here and we have to land."

"Why do you have to land?"  Andrea interjected.  The NASA engineer
had floated into the room unnoticed during their debate.  "Why can't
you just go back to Earth?  You've already accomplished more than
almost any other space mission.  This will go down along with
with Gagarin's flight and Armstrong's moon landing..."

"We have to land!" the captain shouted.  Alister and Vic stopped work
two modules away and moved closer to try to overhear more of the
conversation.

"If we don't land," he continued, "they'll say we failed, and then the
capitalists will just come back two years from now and make the first
landing on Mars; heck, they'll probably use our technology to do it."

"So let them!" Andrea shot back, drawing only a snort in reply.  "Why
do you have to risk everything just to win your private little war?"

"Well, maybe you find this hard to understand from your cushy NASA
perch," Marcellus continued, his voice dripping with sarcasm, "but
there's a lot of people back home rooting for us to show the world
that you don't have to become one of these ruthless bums to get
something done in life."

"Don't you?  Haven't you?" she challenged him.  "How many millions did
_you_ steal, captain?  How many toes did you step on?  Don't tell me
you haven't become ruthless!"

"If you learn to live with disappointment, she'll never leave you
for another man."

"We are landing this plane on Mars," Mercurio stated slowly and
firmly, in a no-nonsense command tone of voice.  "That has been
the goal of this mission from day one.  We take the risks as they
come, but we have a mission plan and we're going to carry it out."

"OK, if we're going to do that..." Burns started, then stopped as
Andrea flung herself through the hatchway, muttering something
about "just like NASA" as she zoomed away through the spacecraft.

"If we're going to do that," Burns continued, "I want to make at least
one test pass where we just reenter through the atmosphere, fly down
there without landing and come back up.  That way, we can take some
low-level photographs of the landing area to make sure there aren't
any nasty surprises waiting for us.  We might even want to survey
several landing areas before we pick one; we've got plenty of fuel
now.  We should move everything critical to the module stack, because
it'll stay in orbit and have to act as a command post."

"Sounds good.  Let's start getting ready."


T + 637 days

"We saw this with the _Challenger_ accident," Burns was saying.  More
than a million people were watching the crew conference on television.
Most cable TV systems now carried the _Icarus_ video feed for at least
part of the day, and the video bar "Live - Mars Orbit" had become a
standard fixture on many a television.

"The first indications of the problem were visual, but nobody was
looking at those particular cameras during the launch.  And although
we've got cameras we can operate remotely, the fact remains that a
manned presence in orbit is still by far our best observation option."

"So someone has to stay behind," Merceriou stated.  It wasn't
a surprise; landing options had been discussed even before
construction had began.

"Since I'm the only one here with experience piloting a 747, I figure
I have to go," Burns said.

Mercuriou spoke again, after a pause.  "I think the command function,
so to speak, has to remain in orbit, so I'll stay here."

"Alister should stay, too," Burns continued.  "I think it's important
for one of the engineers to remain in orbit, and he knows more about
the overall setup of the spaceship than anyone but me, well, maybe
Andrea, too, at this point."

The South African was staring silently at the bulkhead in front of
him.  "Sorry, kid," Burns apologized.  Alister nodded.

"I'll stay," Andrea volunteered.  "Alister can go, if he wants, but I
think I've got a pretty good idea of how the ship is run that Marc and
I can handle things here."  She had remained silent up until this
point in the conversation, mainly because her opposition to the
entire landing attempt was by now well known to the crew.

"You'll probably need help with the refueling, if nothing else," Vic
told Burns.  "If Alister doesn't go, I will."

"So," Mercuriou summarized, "Burns goes, Andrea and I stay, and either
Vic or Alister goes, and the other one stays."

"Let Alister go," Vic continued.  "He's young.  Give him the chance to
walk on Mars."

"No," Merceriou stated, after a pause.  "Andrea knows a lot about the
ship, that's true, but I won't have both the engineers on the ground."
Now it was his turn to apologize to Alister.  "Sorry, kid."

"Anything could go wrong.  You're not landing on a runway; your tires
could blow out; you could even crash.  You could be unable to refuel
for some reason.  We have absolutely no ground support _whatsoever_.
We've never even _attempted_ a reentry in this vehicle, and it certainly
wasn't designed for it.  And we have no rescue option should
_anything_ go wrong."

For the last time, Andrea was trying to convince Merceriou to cancel
the landing attempt.  The meeting was in the captain's quarters; only
Burns, Yeats, and Merceriou were present.

"There was no rescue option on Apollo, either," the captain noted.
"When they had problems on Apollo 13, they just had to work it out,
and that's what we'll have to do if we have problems here."

"Apollo was risky.  Three astronauts had already died in Apollo 1;
they were in this crazed moon race with the Russians trying to prove
that communism wasn't some great advanced new society, a lot like this
crazy venture which is half about trying to prove that capitalism and
democracy aren't all they're cracked up to be, and _still_, Apollo was
a better design."  Merceriou started to shake his head, but Andrea
wouldn't be stopped.  "The entire vehicle was designed from the start
with spaceflight in mind; they had tested the lunar module in Earth
orbit on Apollo 9; they had tested the lunar module in lunar orbit on
Apollo 10; and they might even have been able to race Apollo 12 as a
rescue mission if 11 had gotten stuck on the moon."

"The moon does make a lot more sense than Mars," Burns observed.
"Heck, the astroid belt makes a lot more sense than Mars.  We've
only..."

Mercuriou cut him off.

"We're not in lunar orbit, this isn't a mission to the asteriod belt,
this is a mission to Mars, that's where we are, and that's where we're
going."

Burns broke the silence that followed.

"I'm just trying to give you an objective engineering assessment.
We're picked a hard target.  The moon's got one-sixth Earth gravity
and no atmosphere.  Nobody's ever attempt to land on another planet
before.  We're definitely pushing the envelope in a big way."

"Bottom line, will this work or not - objective engineering
assessment?"

"I can't read into a crystal ball, Marc.  Yes, for all it's
disadvantages, I think the vehicle is as sound as Apollo, 'cause
Apollo had big disadvantages too.  Spaceflight is _dangerous_.  More
than anything else, as I've told you from the beginning, we should
have more than one ship.  Three ships worked for Christopher Columbus,
and it's hard to argue with the results from _that_ mission."

"So you think we should go back and get two more ships?"  A twinge
of sarcasm had now crept into the captain's voice.

"Ideally, we should never had left Earth orbit without more ships."

Mercuriou drifted backwards, stared at the posters on the
wall of his cabin and slowly shook his head.

"We didn't come all this way to turn back now.  We're landing on
Mars."


T + 650 days

The bottom line was that any reentry attempt, even without a landing,
required flying the 747 in atmospheric flight.  Only Burns had ever
flown a 747.  Furthermore, the thin Martian air required a much higher
airspeed and possibly presented handling challenges to the pilot.
Only Burns, it seemed, could make a reentry attempt, and after the
incident in the asteroid belt, the Captain decided against sending
Alister with him.  Finally, it was decided that he would pilot the
aircraft alone.

Disaster on Mars.  Burns attempts to land the 747, but they hadn't
gotten everything figured quite right.  The wings snap off during
reentry and the whole thing goes up in a fireball.  Burns dies.

The wings of the aircraft had been designed to flex, yet the carbon
coating was rigid.  Burns and Alister had correctly calculated the
aerodynamic forces from the reentry, and the dense layer of carbon
was strong enough to withstand those forces, yet hairline cracks
began to creep into the carbon during reentry.

Burns' first warning was a loud crack that sounded like a firecracker
or gunshot.

"What was that?" he wondered aloud.

The answer came less than a second later, as the left wing tore away
from the fuselage and slammed into the tail before falling away
towards the red planet below.  Liquid hydrogen gushed from the jagged
hole in the plane's left side as it swerved into an uncontrollable
spin.  The right wing crumbled under the new stresses, but before much
more could happen one of the remaining engines ignited the leaking
hydrogen and the entire aircraft disappeared into a ball of flame.

In orbit, the Icarus crew were first stunned by the sudden loss of
telemetry, then watched speechless as the aircraft flamed red on black
against the planet surface below, then disintegrated into hundreds of
tiny meteors that streaked silently into the Martian dawn.

-----

The carbon coating itself was strong enough to withstand the
forces of reentry and thick enough to act as an effective heatshield.
The coverings on the wheelwells was a different story.  Removing
them to test them, then replacing them and recovering them had
introduced cracks and fissures along their edges, where they
joined to the main body of the spaceplane.  Now, during reentry,
the superheated gases began working into these cracks around
the edges.  Finally, one of the coverings detached completely,
broke off in a single piece, and let the superheated gas pass
through to the aluminum airplane skin beneath.  In less than
a second, a hole the size of the wheelwell had burn completely
through the plane.

From orbit, the _Icarus_ crew saw a red dot appear on the left
wing of the spaceplane about a minute into reentry.  On board
the 747, Burns heard a load pop.

"What was that?" he wondered aloud.

Alarms started going off in the cockpit.  The puncture had
passed right through the wing's fuel tank and ignited the
fuel, which now poured out the hole in the top of the wing
in a geyser of flame.

"Looks like something on the left wing," Mercurio noted, looking over
at the computer telemetry coming from the spaceplane.  "You might have
lost part of the heatshield."

Even before he finished speaking, the same thing happened to the
wheelwell covering on the right wing and a second geyser of
flame erupted from it.

"I've got flames coming out of the right wing now," Burns observed
from the right-hand pilot's seat, looking over his shoulder.  "We
might be losing the heatshield," he speculated as a knot formed
tighter in his stomach.

There was nothing he could do at the moment about the heatshield, but
as great as that concern was, he also had to worry about the fuel in
the wing tanks.  Without sufficient fuel, he couldn't return to orbit.

"I'm aborting reentry," he declared as he made a snap decision.
Starting the engines for a return to orbit would be dangerous,
but if he lost much of the fuel, it'd be a moot point, since he'd
lack the fuel to return to orbit.

In orbit, Andrea suddenly realized why the two failure points
seems so symmetrically positioned on the wings.

"It's the wheelwells," she declared, and the rest of the crew
turned towards her.  "The wheelweels are failing."

Before anyone could say another word, or do anything, the third
wheelweel, almost directly beneath the cockpit, failed.  A torrent of
flame erupted into the cockpit from below.  Clad in his spacesuit,
Burns was swept out into the Mach 13 flowstream.  The acceleration
alone probably killed him instantly, even before his spacesuit was
consumed by the raging flames that engulfed the crew compartment.

From orbit, the crew watched a third speck of red appear at the
front of the plane, neatly centered, just short of the nose.
At the same moment, all the telemetry ceased, as the cockpit
computers were destroyed by the flames from the breach.

"Burns?" Mercurio asked a dead com link.  "Burns?"

Without control computers to balance manuevering thrusters and control
surfaces, the spaceplane lost its equilibrium, pitched back and began
to yaw.  The aerodynamic forces of the hypersonic airflow overwealmed
the now unstable spaceplane.  The left wing snapped off the
fuselage, and slammed into the tail...

"OK, now this is what Alister recorded on the high-speed film."

Lou's face disappeared and the video transmission changed into a
crystal-clear and dramatic vision of the last seconds of the 747, seen
from almost directly above, being buffeted in slow motion by wind
gusts.

"We've been able to enhance it now to clearly show the eddies."

The monitor still showed the 747, now overload with a grid of hundreds
of tiny pressure vectors.  They clearly showed very strong vortexs
coming off the running engines, enlarging and growing instead of
contracting, all turning counterclockwise and forming into a massive
counterclockwise disturbance that engulfed the aircraft.  Just as it
began to break up, NASA Houston cut back onto the monitor.  Lou was
sitting in his accustomed place behind a long desk with computer
monitors strung out in front of it and white-shirted engineers both
standing and seated behind.

Lou's face cut back onto the monitor.

Andrea squirmed.  She wanted to see the final breakup in slow
motion, but she could get that later from Alister.  More than
anything, she wanted to interject and ask Lou to show the
rest of the film, but the 30-minute communications time lag
prevented it.

"Andrea, we don't have any idea what happened other than it looks like
the engines triggered a massive atmospheric disturbance, and absolutely
nothing in any of our Martian atmospheric models predicts anything
like it.  There were a lot of things we were afraid could go wrong
with the vehicle but this wasn't one of them.  Incidently, our
spectroscope analysis showed water vapor in the engine's wake,
which isn't produced by ten-thirty-three and isn't in the Martian
atmosphere, so we're wondering if something down there 
in the reaction byproducts triggered additional reactions in
the Martian atmosphere, but this is all just educated guesswork."

"And we still don't think the crash was survivable, so I really
have to advise against your resupply plan.  I know you want
to do it, and so do I, but I'm looking at it from the angle
of maybe needing those supplies to get the three of you home."

"That's all for now."

The transmission ended and was replaced by the usual screen cluster on
the projector - a diagram of their orbit position, their coordinates
in three different reference frames, a clock in universal time.

The two astronauts were silent.  Mercuriou could have been viewing the
transmission as well from his cabin, but there was no immediate way to
tell.

Alister said nothing, but stared at Andrea, almost dumbly awaiting
instructions.

"The resupply module?" she asked.

"It's got everything on our primary checklist, and a couple of things
from our secondary, too."

"Let's see."

Alister scribbled an instruction on his tablet and the checklist
appeared in a window on Andrea's. _Lou_will_want_to_see_this_.
She scribbled another instruction on her machine and a copy
of the file began its 10,000,000 km (check this) journey.

She knew everything on both lists, having helped compose them, and
skipped the primary checklist, since Alister said it was loaded.  That
meant they had oxygen, water, first aid equipment, radio equipment,
rescue balls, both large - a good-sized, circular tent when inflated,
and small - two men in spacesuits could just fit into one, and a small
quanity of the remaining military rations.  It was the secondary
checklist she was more concerned with, and not all of it, but only the
part that contained things more valuable, more irreplacible.  They had
begun to form in her mind a third checklist even.  None of them were
packed except one - a pair of spacesuits.  _Icarus_ would then be left
with only two.

Alister made her command decision, not to send the spacesuits, but
said nothing as yet and instead excused herself from the
rec-room-turned-bridge and entered the captain's quarters, closing
the hatch behind her.

Less than sixty seconds later she was back.

"What'd he say?" Alister asked.

"He said that I'm in command, that I should do whatever I want."

"OK."

"Remove the spacesuits from the resupply module and launch it."

The resupply module was launched the same way all the others had been.
Nearly a hundred of the silicon carbide engines Burns had
mass-produced in Mexico had been themselves packed ten at a time into
cargo modules and launched.  The EVA to place the engines
on the fuel modules had been performed.  One of them had
been manuefered and attached to an empty, cleaned fuel module
docked to bay one.


"I want a bulls-eye on the center of the 747's crash site."


.....


"I'm placing you under a suicide watch."

"You're doing what?"

Mercuriou turned away from the window and confronted his first officer.
Secretly, Andrea was glad to see this reaction, much more so than
quiet resignation, but this she tried not to show.

"You heard me."

The Captain emitted a "Humph", "So what's this suicide watch supposed
to be?  You've got a police guard in mind?"

"Me.  I'm the police guard.  I'm not leaving you out of my sight."

Merceriou took this in slowly.

"OK," he shrugged at last and turned back to the window.  Andrea
propelled herself to the terminal on his desk and keyed the intercom
switch for Alister...


....

"Disaster on Mars" scream the newspapers.

The end result was a half-hour time lag in communications that left
both NASA and the rest of the planet as passive observers of the
dramatic video footage relayed to them.

Most world goverments issue statements of condolence.  The United
States is critized in Europe for the lukewarm nature of its official
comment.

A tense but unharmed crew holds a staff meeting.  The Captain is silent.

"OK, we should assemble the cargo modules into a chain, and get ready
to go home," Vic began.

"We can't assemble the cargo modules without the 747," Alister interjected.
"At least, we can't yet.  I need to run some simulations.  We've got
the cargo modules from the asteroid belt that we rigged to push things
around, but I've got to figure how to get them... lined up in a row."

"Well, how do we do that."

"I don't know."

"What do you mean, what's the first thing to do?"

"I don't know.  I guess, I guess I've got to think about it for a while."

The room fell silent.

"Can you do it?" Brian asked quietly.

"Do what?  Put the things in a row?  I think so."

"Can you get us home?"

Again the room was quiet.  Everyone except the Captain and Dr. Yeats
was looking at Alister.  Finally Alister blurted out.

"I don't know."

The NASA engineer looked up.  She had been thinking carefully about
what she wanted to say.  "Alister's not alone.  I've got more hours of
spaceflight logged than anyone else here."

Vic furrowed his eyebrows.  It was the first time he had thought about
it, but Dr. Andrea Yeats would for many years hold the record for most
lifetime hours of spaceflight.  She went on.

"And we've got this whole crew.  Alister's the chief engineer now, so
if says he needs time to think about it and simulate it, fine.  He'll
need help.  I can make myself do equations again.  I volunteer as
assistant engineer."

Bryan said, "We need you as first officer."

Vic volunteers as assistant engineer, is accepted in lue of Dr. Yeats,
and the meeting adjours.

The Captain stops coming to staff meetings.

Alister's face is plastered on the Earth tabloids.  "Can the kid get
them home?" one asks.  Another focused on lurid details, supplied
by a panel of experts, on what Burns' last moments must have been
like.  U.S. rags like to publish how Edgar Cayce's prophesies had
fortold the disaster.

Dr. Yeats took to organizing Burns' library, made sure Alister had
everything he asked for, suggested some books he hadn't thought about,
and reading a bit herself.


T + 658 days

Alister begins maneuvering the cargo modules.  He can get them home,
but the trip's going to take a lot longer than anyone had planned on.

Without the 747,  all they could do was line up all the modules
in more or a less a row, with one rocket engine in the very rear,
and spend days under light thrust to make a burn.


T + 690 days

The captain drifted into the compartment and the conversation stopped.

"Need anything, sir?" Bryan asked.

"No, I'm just going to the infirmatory for an ibuprofin."  He drifted
across and out through the hatch.  Andrea pulled out of the footholds
and followed him.  He was going through the tablets as she entered
the infirmatory, and hardly looked up to see who it was.

"So what are you thinking?" she said after a moment.

He answered with a snort.  "You don't want to know what I'm thinking."

"Yes, I do."  He looked up at her.  "I really want to know what you're
thinking."

He looked back down at the capsules in his hand, dry swallowed two and
shoved the rest back into the container.  Then he floated still and
was silent for a while before answering.

"I knew this thing was dangerous.  I guess I just always figured if
somebody was going to die, it was going to be me, so... so what,
right?  I didn't think it would be my best friend."

"We all knew it was dangerous..." she started to answer.

"No.  You were right.  I've cut so many corners on this thing, this
mission, I might as well have reached out and killed them myself.
I... I just don't...  I just should never have come."

Andrea lowered her voice, moved closer, and took Marcelius Mercurio by
the arm.

"Look, let me tell you something I've never really told anyone.  I've
been on three space shuttle launches, and watched a dozen more from
Mission Control.  And every time, I mean _every_time_ they say those
words 'Go at throttle up'..."  Her voice drifted off and she choked
back tears.

"You know why Challenger blew up?  The engineers knew it was too cold
to launch.  But Ronald Reagan was giving a speech, and he wanted his
teacher in space, and the mission managers thought, well, maybe we
can let it slid a bit this time, no big deal."

"Everyone cuts corners," she continued.  "People cut corners driving
their cars - 'oh, I didn't have that much to drink, I'll be OK to drive' -
people cut corners at work - 'it'll be OK, we need to get it out
by the deadline' - people cut corners at home - 'Johny'll have another
ball game next week, I'll make that one'.  People cut corners all the
time - it's a fact of life," she emphasized as he shook his head and
pulled away.

"Not when people's lives are at stake," he answered.

"You're a perfectionist," she stated in a matter-of-fact tone.

"You're damn right I'm a perfectionist," he shot back.

"And they died because you weren't perfect.  Your plan wasn't perfect,
your software wasn't perfect, and you weren't perfect."  He looked her
right in the eye.  "But I knew your plan wasn't perfect, and I came
anyway.  And they knew it wasn't perfect, and they still followed
you."  Now he looked down and away.  "And I know _you_'re not
perfect... but I still love you."

Mercurio didn't say anything in response, nor did he look up.  Andrea
waited a moment longer, then returned to the smokers in the com shack.

"I can't beleive I just said that," she mumbled to herself.

"Said what?" Alister asked.


T + 692 days

"Look, I guess you can forgive me... I just don't know if I can forgive
myself.  I mean..." his voice drifted off.

"It's over.  It may take you a long time to forgive yourself; heck,
you may _never_ forgive yourself, but it's over.  You made a mistake,
now it's time to go on, because there's no other place to go."

He nodded and said "OK", but wasn't really sure himself if he could do it.

Mercurio pulled himself into the com shack a bit faster and bit more
focused than he'd done in weeks.  "Alister?"

"Sir?" the younger looked up from his computer game.

"Plot a trajectory for Earth.  We break orbit in three days."


T + 695 days

"OK, we've got OMS-17 now," Alister announced.  He, along with the
Andrea and Mercuriou, were suited up and strapped in.  Alister was
operating the computer that controlled the big-screen display.  The
others had their own computers, and Andrea was glancing back and forth
between the big screen and the checklist on own.  Mercuriou was
watching Alister on the display as he checked the computer settings.

"OMS-17 is a 37.42 mega-newton burn at 374 by 1 solar at 13:42 on T +
695.  Today _is_ T + 695.  Current time is 13:17 Universal.  Ship's
inertial attitute is 351 by 11 solar, but that... will rotate into 374

OMS-17 has a tappered entry and step cut-off, check.  It is 7 minutes
and 13 seconds in duration, check.  And it will put us on a course
back to Earth..."

"You give to others because that's how we were taught to live by Jesus."

Vic spoke first.  "What if you don't necessarily beleive in Jesus?"

"Well, I guess people used to believe the Earth is flat.  You can
beleive whatever you want; the fact is that the Earth is round.  And
I'm absolutely convinced that Jesus of Nazarath was the most
spiritually advanced being to ever live on Earth.  So we should take
his teachings seriously."

Mercuriou: "We don't run this ship.  Burns runs this ship.  This ship
is just running on auto-pilot now."

Andrea thought about this for a moment.

"Well, we better make sure we know everything we can about how that
auto-pilot works."

With cork puller still attached, the cork went flying unheaded across
the cabin as the Captain grabed for the plastic cover and slapped it over
the top of the wine bottle.  Even so, several gobs of the red alcohol
went floating into the air, the liquid's surface tension forming them
into perfectly round spheres.  Andrea shook her head.

"You'd think that after two and a half years in space, you'd have learned
how to open a wine bottle without spilling it everywhere."

"What I've learned," the Captain answered, as he spun across the
compartment and swallowed one of the larger floating drops, "is that
if you spill red wine in space, it's a lot easier to clean up than on
Earth!"

Mercurio spilt only a few more drops as he "poured" the wine into two
wine glasses, each one quickly covered with a flat plastic square.
Drinking from straws was much easier, but Marc had dug into the ship's
stores an hour earlier, produced the glasses alongside the bottle, and
Andrea had stood on tradition.

"Cheers."

They clinked glasses and laughed together as the Captain spilled wine
all over his face as he tried to drink it.  Andrea grabbed a towel and
started to wipe off his face.

"You guys better come in here!" Alister yelled, then got up and
propelled himself through the hatchway.

"Well, m-maybe you want to come in here," he stammered as he realized
that he was interrupting a "private" dinner.

"What's up?" the Captain asked.

"Somebody just smashed an airplane into the World Trade Center!"

Burns once told Mercuriou that there are no great men, only great
ideas, and that genius is that rare ability to venture deep into the
dim recesses of ideaspace to retrieve the rare gems, that energy and
mass are the same thing, related by the square of the speed of light.
Why the speed of light?  Why it's _square_?  That's the diamond of
Einstein's genius.  Tom Clancy was such a genius.  Mohammamed Ata was
another.  Both men had discovered the same fiery sapphire, that
unbenonst to the masses of mortal men, a passenger jet can be used as
a _guided_missile_.  One of these geniuses buried his discovery in the
pages of a novel.  The other held up it's blazing red light for all
the world to see that terrible September morning.

At 1431 GMT, September 11, 2001, after first the event on Earth and
then a radio transmission lag of exactly 3 minutes 17 seconds, the
silent crew of three watched the second tower collapse.  In the days
ahead, it would be revealed that Islamic terrorists had hijacked four
American airlines.  Coincidently, or perhaps not, all were Boings.
Two had slammed, full throttle, into the twin towers of World Trade
Center, at one time the tallest buildings in the world, and
headquarters to dozens of major companies.  Burns would have suggested
imagining the pictures you've seen of jet crash scenes, then trying to
project it 100 stories above you onto a skyscraper in lower Manhattan.
Within hours, the buildings fell.  Burns would have then made a quick
calculation based on the potential energy of a given mass at a given
height along with the published weight of construction materials used
in the skyscrapers to estimate the energy released by their collapse
at ten kilotons of TNT - the size of a small atomic bomb.  Bankers,
mail men, fire fighters, bus boys - all lost their lives that terrible
morning.

Within days, the nation mobilized.  Medical teams sprung into action,
fire fighters dove into the wreckage alongside men who walked up on
the street and volunteered, desperate to find anything or anyone still
alive in the tons of rubble.  At Andrea's suggestion, Mercuriou issued
a statement of condolence, expressing his "deapest reget", and stating
that it grieved him as nearly as much the death of his "dear friend
Burns".  The entire crew followed suit.  Asked via videomail by the
press about his comparison with Burns, he replied that though he
deeply felt the loss in New York, he was sure the family's victims
would concer that no one feels a loss more acutely than that of a
loved one.  The media largely accepted this.

Within weeks, the President attacked Afghanistan after correctly
finguring Osama bin Ladin as the culprit.  The Captain began objecting
to the President's behavior, stating publically than an orderly extradition
procedure should be followed rather than an invasion.  Andrea Yeats
said that all parties should try to resolve their problems peacefully,
though she ruefully noted that the Muslems would do good to accept
Christ, and ruffled feathers by suggesting that the terrorists,
misguided though they may have been, were probably the only people
that morning who got on the airplanes because they were trying to do
God's will.

Within months, most of the old animosities had resurfaced.  The
Captain was still openly critical of the western democratic
establishment in general, and the President in particular.
Dr. Yeats became far more prominent, and far more controversial, by
her repeated advice to end the war, moarn over the dead, then ask
ourselves why so many people hated the country and decide to give our
lives over to God to do something about it.

Within a year, it had become obvious to many people that the September
11th attack was not simply an outrageous act of terrorism, but in fact
a devastatingly effective act of unconventional warfare.
Osama bin Ladin wasn't a mad terrorist out to kill as many
people as he could.  He was a genius stratagition, fighting
against the democracy he perceived as his people's mortal enemy, who knew
he'd get one shot at his brillent plan, and was determined
to make it work by striking the hardest blow he could muster
at his arch-enemy's political and financial infrastructure.
While the
political prong of the twin assult had failed, the economic prong had
succeeded beyond belief.
Considering not only the twin towers
of the World Trade Center, but the smaller buildings destroyed,
or ravaged with all their windows blown out, plus the entire
multi-block area that had been shut down for months, the center
of New York City's financial district had been devastated.

Economies are complex systems, where events
trigger other events, coast for a time, reflect from boundaries, then
interact again, much like ripples on a pond, or perhaps a pile of
leaves in the wind.  Mathemticins, economists, and mathematically
inclined economists study the statistical response of economies, but
the impulse functions of such entities are not completely understood.
The intricate network of buyers, sellers, consumers, suppliers,
distributors, bankers, salesman, real estate agents, and thousands of
other occupations that form The Economy, that much-worshiped god of
business plans, spreadsheets, balance sheets and profit-and-loss
statements that the Captain would have called the Global Capitalist
Economic System, had been dealt a crippling blow.  The stock market
was down.  And it stayed down.  As the analysts puzzled over corporate
earnings ratios, and how many bargins were popping up on the market
these days, and how a bottoming out had to occur soon, amid patriotic
demonstrations of pride and determination, an almost insane euphoria
that the terrorists would only "win" if we let them, and coming on the
heels of a burst speculative bubble the year before, day after day,
week and week, month after month, the market kept going down, down,
and down.  As the Dow Jones Industrial Average, that bellweather of
American business performance, once pegged spectacuarly above 10,000,
now dipped below 1000, and as the men and women of the U.S began to
realize, in the inmortal words of John Kenneth Galbriegth describing a
similar collapse many years ago, "there was no limit to how far down
the market could go", the _Icarus_ came home.  the gravity of their
situation.
Into this environment, the _Icarus_ came home.

By the time the _Icarus_ was close enough to Earth orbit that the
videomail was no longer needed, the U.S. was looking for heros, and
for the men and women of the disastrously successful space mission,
their hour had come.  Practically the entire anti-government movement
finally dropped all their quibbles and lined up behind Marceleus
Mercurio, ready to declare peace or war at his whim.  Some ministers
and many religious people believed Andrea Yeats was a genuine
spiritual leader.  Others added up the letters of her name in Chinese
to obtain 666.  Alister Compton was declared the world's sexiest
astronaut by a popular poll.  Vic spent hours on end holed up, working
on a proposal to reform medical care that the AMA had invited him to
make, and Bryan and his men were informally told that all charges
against them would be dropped if they'd sign up as the U.S's first
squad of Space Rangers.  Several proposals were floated for a memorial
to Burns.

The President told Mercurio that his was willing to send the space
shuttle to retrieve them, but that he and his men would be arrested
upon return to Earth and charged with crimes against them.  He hinted
that they would probably be released on their own recognizance, but
the Captain would hear none of it.  As the media began to speculate
about what kind of legal reception awaited the crew, the Captain
agreed to the shuttle proposal, primarily because he had no other way
to return to Earth from orbit.

"Took advantage of freedom!?"  Mercuriou practically spit the words
out.  The old Mercuriou was back, the Mercuriou that hadn't
faced disaster on Mars, the Mercuriou that hadn't listened
to Andrea Yeats for the last two years.

"Took advantage of freedom!  You make it sound like anybody can just
walk up to one of these training companies, 'hey, I'd like to learn to
fly a 767'... 'sure, no problem'.  You've got to have _money_ to fly!
All those people out there who'd love to fly an airplane but can't or
don't because _it's_too_expensive_... Took advantage of freedom!  They
took advantage of _capitalism_!  They had the one thing that will make
people say 'yes' in a society that says 'no', 'No', 'NO' - money!
They took advantage of the fact that Osama bin Laden is a
_multimillionare_!"

"Well, who you gonna attack?  The political leaders, the President?"
Mercuriou was all fired up after hearing the latest news broadcasts
from Earth.  "They'll just elect a new one and keep going, all hot to
avenge him, too.  I mean, who really is responsible?  Isn't it the
people, themselves?  The majority that elects these guys?  Isn't it
really _the_people_ who run democracy, so shouldn't we hold
_the_people_ responsible?  And isn't that who was in the World Trade
Center?"

"Certainly not all of them, for starters.  The attack was completely
indiscriminate."

"Completely indiscriminate!  Completely indiscriminate!  The attack
was directly focused on the biggest symbol of capitalism on this
planet!  I mean, those people in there were _the_true_beleivers_!
They were the _capitalists_!"

"I'm sure there were window washers there too, captain."

"OK, fine.  A lot of innocent people died.  But the majority of the
people in those twin towers represented the majority of the people of
the United States.  I mean, this kind of crap!" he gestured to the now
silent television monitor.  "All we keep hearing about is this is what
the majority wants, this is the voice of the majority, the majority,
the majority, like they're the only ones that count!  Well,
_the_majority_ of the people in those towers were _capitalists_, they
didn't come to work that morning to help make the world a better
place, they were _in_it_for_themselves_ because
_that's_what_runs_democracy."

"It doesn't make a difference."

"It doesn't make a difference!?!  And on God's earth, why, woman, why?"

"Because you _forgive_your_enemies_, as I've tried to tell you about a
hundred times," Andrea was becoming irate.  "You don't smash airplanes
into their skyscrapers because they imposed some global capitalist
system on you, and you don't go off invading foreign countries because
they don't turn terrorist leaders over to you when you bark out your
dictats."

[hopefully, this is our first mention of Afganistan, and it shocks the
reader a bit]

Mercuriou was silent for a moment.

"There's a lot of young men dying in that country right now because
they're going to do what they've been told all their life, that their
country is under attack, and it's their duty to defend it, and
everything our boys have been told and believe!  And this guy, this
president, he doesn't declare war, he doesn't attempt some extridition
process, he doesn't try to get a security council resolution, he just
declares, 'if you're not with us, you're against us', and just barks
out this order to hand over bin Laden!  I mean, the same stupid thing
that started World War I!  And where was all the screaming then, that
Austria had been attacked by _terrorists_, _TERRORISTS_ I tell you,
and their allies - Russia, France, English, and THE UNITED STATES were
supporting _TERRORISM_!!!"

"This is what they thought the _Icarus_ launch was.  This is why they
started screeming then about a chemical weapons attack.  'Terrorism in
space', ha!  They figured that someone else, someone mad as hell,
another Timothy McVae, another Theodore Kidinsky, another Osama bin
Laden, had launched some big bunch of anthrax or something into
space!  They're guilty as hell, the whole bunch of 'em, the whole
_majority_, and they're just waiting for the next blow to fall!"

"My God!" he exclaimed.  "Can they really not figure it out?!  Can
they really not see that capitalism is one of the most depraved
philosphies that has even been proposed for men to live?!  Can they
really believe all their own propaganda and think this thing is some
kind of utopia?  I mean, which is worse: fascism, based on just
conquering your neighbors; communism, based on overthrowing your
government in some revolution; or capitalism, based on just doing for
yourself and letting some _invisible_hand_ take care of the rest?"

"Maybe they're just incompetent," Alister interjected.

"Incompotent?" Mercuriou answered.  Yeats, too, raised a puzzled eye.

[maybe this is the first time in the book Alister really has something to say]

"Yeah, like me trying to fly this spaceship.  Incompetent."

The crew broke out in laughter as his self-defacing humor.  Encouraged,
he went on.

"No, really, maybe people just don't know the difference between right
and wrong.  Maybe they can't choose good leaders because they don't
know how."

Mercuriou said nothing, but the expression that ran across his face
told him to be in accord with the young man's words.  Andrea broke
the silence.

"It's very hard to tell the difference between right and wrong,
Alister.  That's why Christianity is so important.  It gives us very
important guideposts to help make those decisions."

Alister: "What would Vic have thought about all this?"

Andrea: "Vic probably would have said that we're too primitive
as a species to possess a technology as advanced as jet aircraft.
He was always advocating a return to simpler times."

Mercuriou: "Do you beleive we're too advanced for jet aircraft?"
There was no trace of sarcasm in his voice.  He had already concluded
that humanity was too primitive to be flying to Mars, was genuinely
wondering about jet aircraft, and wanted Andrea's opinion.

Andrea took a deep breath before answering.

"I beleive technology is neutral.  It's a tool; just a different kind
of tool, a knowledge-based tool.  Tools aren't good or evil; it's what
men choose to do with them that makes them good or evil.  No, that's
not quite right, the tool isn't made good or evil, it's the choice
itself that forms good and evil.  I agree with Vic to the extent that
we're really too primitive to even evaluate good and evil.  I mean, a
significant segment of mankind still beleives that God doesn't exist."

Alister frowned, puzzled.  "You think that makes us primitive?"

"Sure," Andrea replied.  "A lot of people once beleived that the Earth
was stationary and the Sun revolved around it.  Do you think that
people with that belief are too primitive for manned spaceflight?"

"Manned spaceflight would be basically impossible with that belief
set," Mercuriou answered.

"Don't be so sure," Andrea answered.  "Men sailed around the globe
without even accurate timepieces to measure longitude.  Planck
formulated the core of quantum mechanics based on the amount of light
given off by a block of metal as you heat it.  The first computers
were built with _vacuum_tubes_, not transistors.  Don't underestimate
human ingenuity, Captain."

Merciriou was forced to grin, and Andrea continued.

"The point is that such a belief set is a severe handicap to manned
spaceflight, but doesn't exclude it completely.  Likewise, atheism is
a severe handicap to making moral value judgements, but doesn't
completely preclude figuring out that murder is wrong, at least in
some cases.  In other cases, you'll find people absolutely insisting
that they _have_to_kill_ for the sake of their 'freedom'.  You'll find
people who _do_ believe in God clinging to this belief that it's moral
to impose all these copyright and patent and intellectual property
restrictions on this technology, that basically results in this
knowledge, and these tools based on it, being available only to those
with money, and then absolutely insisting that this is consistent with
the Christian gospel.  That's how primitive we are.  Two thousand
years ago we were told _Give_to_all_those_who_beg_of_you_ and half of
us still can't understand what that really means."

...

Vic: "Well, one thing this attack suggests to me is that we're
not sufficiently advanced as a species to possess jet aircraft.
I wouldn't have said that a month ago; I certainly would have said
that we're not advanced enough to possess nuclear technology,
but now I have to say that it doesn't even look like we're
advanced enough to possess jet aircraft.  Spiritually, we're not
that far pass the bow and arrow stage, it seems."

"Do you support the War on Terror?"

Andrea: "I don't support any war.  Christ taught us to forgive our enemies,
and that's exactly what we should do.  In one sense, it shouldn't
be that hard since the men who actually carried out the attacks
died along with everyone else.  It's time to bury the dead,
mourn over the victims, clean up the rubble, and really ask
ourselves why our country is so hated that people would do
this to us.  And that answer is pretty clear, I think."

"Dr. Yeats, what is the answer?  What do you think the U.S. should do
next?"

"I think we decide to really help the people of the world instead of
just talking constantly about (money and) politics.  Let's take all
this technology, publish everything we know about how it works, make
all that information freely available on the Internet, help third
world countries develop their own microchip manufacuring facilities,
their own chemical plants, their own robotic factories, etc.  Of
course, that means giving up our 'competitive advantage' that we hear
so much about.  It means helping people feed themselves, helping them
educate themselves, helping them build their own infrastructure,
instead of constantly talking about freedom while we pursue our own
selfish ends."

"What about the heroism of the hijackers?  What about the heroism of
the young men who were willing to give their lives because they
beleived that they were acting in their people's best interest?
There were probably the only people who got on those planes that
morning because they were trying to do the will of God."

"Why aren't they heros?  We hear constantly about the heros who are
bombing Afghanistan; why are they heros and these men aren't?  I mean,
they were willing to sacrifice their lives for some greater good;
isn't that heroism?  What difference does it make whether the evil
they were trying to fight was capitalism or terrorism, or whether it
really is evil, or if they just beleive it in their minds, or if
terrorism is really heroic, or if war on terrorism is really heoric?
Isn't heroism about giving of yourself for someone else, and even
if it's misguided, isn't it still worthy of our respect?"

Mercurio: "I don't think we need all these security restrictions.
First of all, most of them wouldn't have stopped the terrorists
on 9-11.  They didn't have guns, or bombs, or chemicals of any kind.
And, frankly, a knife is so easy to conceal; I mean, you can take
a sharpened stone that won't trigger a single metal detector,
jam it into the sole of your shoe or something; it'd be so easy to
get knifes on board the airplanes.  I doubt you even need weapons
of any kind.  A half dozen men well trained in martial arts is
probably good enough."

"So how can we stop future attacks?"

"There aren't going to be any future attacks, not like this.  We saw
that in Pennsylanvia.  It took about an hour for the rules to change.
It used to be, if someone hijacked an airplane, you just put up your
hands and said, 'OK, where you want to go?  Claim your responsibility.
Make your demands.'  Now, that's all changed.  The passengers and crew
won't let hijackers take over a plane again.  They'll crash it first.
So there just aren't going to be any more attacks like this one.
That's why they used four planes; they knew it was a one-shot deal."

"So we should just do nothing and let the terrorists win?"

"First of all, a lot of what can be done has been done.  Like I said,
there aren't going to be any more 9-11 style attacks with airplanes.
Next, there isn't a whole lot you can do.  Especially if these anthrax
letters are the next in a series of attacks.  If each attack is
radically different from the last, if each one exploits a different
avenue of attack, really, what can you do?  Maybe hope your intelligence
people can penetrate the organization or at least figure out how
they coordinate and communiate, that's about it.  Everything else
is just reacting to the last attack."

"This notion that they exploited the freedom of our society is absurd.
They exploited capitalism, and they were able to exploit it because
they were backed by a multi-millionaire.  If they didn't have
thousands of dollars in funding, would the great 'free' society have
trained them on how to fly these jets?  Would the airlines have just
let them fly for nothing while they were scouting them out?  Would
they have even been let on the planes that morning if they hadn't
swipped through a credit card first?  Money is how capitalism controls
people, and if the terrorists hadn't had money, the 'free' society
would have slammed every door shut in their faces."

Mercurio cut him off.  "They would never have been let on those planes
without money.  They would never have been let on those planes.  They
didn't exploit freedom... they exploited capitalism!"

After the first burn to put them back onto a course for Earth,
a very late burn, just short of Earth orbit, was required to correct
their final approach vector and insert them into a high parking
orbit from where they could kill their momemtum and drop down
into a circular orbit from where the OTVs could take them down
to a newly built space station (the International Space Station).
Alister had carefully calculated this correctional burn.  It would
take several hours, and be a retrograd burn - they should have turned
the ship around to make the burn.  But the Captain, realizing that
this would be great trouble, elected to move one of the OTVs to
the other side of the long cargo chain and push from there,
applying thrust to the craft in the opposite direction from
that of either the 747 or the engine configuration they had
used to leave Martian orbit.

Twenty five minutes into the burn, the engine died out, and
fuel alarms began going off all over the ship.  In retrospect
the problem was obvious, since the ship's design had used the force
of the thrust to push the fuel to the back of the ship where
large tanks kept the fuel supply pressurized and distributed
it throughout the ship, including to the engine of the OTV
on the far side of the chain, since its onboard supply of fuel
wasn't sufficient to maintain the long burn for a sufficient
duration.  Burns would have anticipated it.  Alister did not.

In fact, all the fuel had passed to the front of the ship's tanks
within minutes of beginning the burn, and only the fuel supply in the
OTV had kept the burn going almost half an hour, as well as keeping
the entire fuel system pressurized.  Alister had in fact noticed the
pressure drop right when the burn started, and told the Captain about
it, but it stabilized at an acceptable level and they continued
the burn.  Now all the fuel had been exhausted from the OTV's tank,
all the fuel in the main tanks was all the way forward, away from
the pressure cylinders and other apparatus in the rear of the craft.
The only remaining fuel immediately at the disposal of the crew
was in small presurized cylinders that acted as pressure equalizers
between each module's fuel cell and the main fuel lines.  They had
stop values that kept their pressurized contents from escaping
back into the purged main line system.  It took the crew about ten
minutes to determine that all their fuel and power would be gone
in about two hours.

"So we'd better shut everything off that we don't absolutely need,"
the Captain concluded.

Alister could close all the values from his computer, so they quickly
tried to decide what they needed and what they didn't.  The
greenhouses came up immediately.  They were the single biggest power
consumer on the ship.  Some of their lights were off, but for the
others an important decision had to be made.

"It might not affect them that much if they were only off for one
light cycle," Vic noted.

"And we've got plenty of food stored up - enough to get us back to
Earth," Andrea noted.

"OK, turn them off," Mercurio ordered.  "Then let's figure out what
we're going to do next."

Figuring that out became quite problamatic.

The ship was considerably less than a light-minute from Earth, so the
latest development was flashed quickly all over the world.
Comparisons began with Apollo 13, the flawed NASA lunar mission that
lost its power halfway to the Moon after an oxygen tank explosion
crippled part of the ship.  Experts said the situation was both less
serious, since there was no explosion or damage to the ship, and more
serious, since the ship was in interplanetary orbit and couldn't just
coast back to Earth without its engines.  The National Enquirer
published a cover story suggesting that some of Nostradomes's
quatrains refered to the _Icarus_, that the death of their brilliant
chief engineer was only the first of many woes to befall the crew, and
that none of them would make it back to Earth alive.

With the exception of Vic and Bryan, the entire crew had been awake
now for twenty four hours.  Every scheme they came up with had flaws.
The reserve fuel had been pumped out of the other OTVs as standard
procedure while they were docked.  The plan was to fuel them before
using them, as Andrea had done prior to launch into the asteroid belt
to save Alister, so their engines were useless.  Using all their fuel
canisters from the various modules, they could pressurize the fuel
system briefly, but at no where near the pressure needed to ignite any
of the thrusters.  Reconnecting the OTV on the far end of the array
directly to the fuel lines, instead of running the fuel down the ship
and pumping it back up, would have worked while the OTV had reserve
fuel, but again, there was no way to apply sufficient fuel pressure to
ignite the engine and begin the burn.  Even siphoning fuel off from
the tanks was nearly imposible, since their main fuel lines were mated
with the rest of the module they were attached to, and thus there was
no way to open the fuel line without undocking the modules, which they
had no fuel to do.  Shunting the fuel from one line to another
permited some to be drawn off into hand held pressure cylinders, but
again at nowhere near the pressure needed to ignite any of the
engines.  It now was becoming apparent that while they could stretch
their available fuel about two weeks, they were going to have serious
problems restarting any of the rocket engines, and therefore couldn't
move the fuel to the rear of the ship where it could easily be drawn
off.


T + 752 days

Alister and Andrea come up with a scheme to divert the gaseous
atmosphere into the fuel lines and shoot spurts of air out of the
various manuefering thrusters.  It would allow them to undock
at least the rear OTV and move around the ship.  Undocking
any significant number of cargo modules was problamatic.  NASA,
by now eager to advise, had almost immediately set its team of
engineers to pour over the problem.  They devised a radical solution.

By expending a lot of their available atmosophere in the OTV,
they could give the entire ship a slight forward nudge.  NASA
had simulated the motion of the fuel in the tanking system
and concluded that a sufficient quantity of fuel to fire the
engines could be reliably be moved through a single tank -
not the 28 it would take to move any of the fuel all the way
back to the pressure tanks in the rear of the craft.  This
idea proved the basis for a desperate gamble.

They would move the entire ship to undock the farthest fuel module,
docked to the OTV, and expend all of the OTV's atmosphere to propel
the fuel back into the OTV's tanks.  If it didn't work, whoever were
the astronauts on the OTV would be effectively gone, floating away
from the ship in a powerless, airless OTV with only their spacesuit
power.  Some thought was given to running the OTV remotely.  While
possible, it would also require the complex return manuefuer to be
done remotely, because the ship would still be dead in space and the
OTV would need to put it underway again.  Doing this remotely was
undesirable.

The Captain was now faced with a crucial decision.  Should he send a
competent OTV party, and risk seperating the crew?  Should he have
everyone go on the OTV, and risk seperation from the cargo modules and
any hope of return to Earth without them?  Should he pilot the OTV
remotely, and risk that some simple malfunction could kill them?

Alister hadn't slept in almost three days.  The Captain ordered him to
take eight hours off, spend it smoking dope, or listening to CDs, or
whatever.  The young engineer started to object, but Vic seconded the
order as a medical directive.  The power was turned back on in his
module, and he smoked the last joint Burns had given him, that they
were going to smoke when he got back from Mars.  Ten minutes later, he
was fast asleep.

Andrea was already going over the burn calculations again when
Alister awoke.  He groaned when he saw the printouts taped
to the walls, the floating physics texts, and the complex
computer systems, running on mimimum power.

"Don't look," Andrea said.  "If you don't want to look, don't
look.  I want you to be fresh and go over this top to bottom
before we try it, but you can take another day off if you
don't want to look at it now."

That was exactly what they did.  Andrea looked over the plan that day,
as did teams of NASA, ESA, and RSA engineers and amateur enthusiasts
everywhere.

T + 754 days

The Captain decided to send both Andrea and Alister,
told them that if it didn't work he was depending on them to find
someway to get the fuel into the OTV.  They would detach from the rear
of the ship in the main OTV, use its atmosphere to manuefuer away from
the ship.  Then the Captain would blow about half the air in the
greenhouses to undock the ship from the last fuel module.  Then Andrea
and Alister would have to move their OTV to the fuel module, while the
rest of the ship moved away from them, dock to it, and use the rest of
their atmosphere to push forward on the fuel module.  Three hours
later, a quanity of fuel should have passed into the OTV's fuel tank,
at which point they would close the values and presurize the fuel
tank.  Pressurize with what?  They would need the atmosphere both to
move the ship and to pressurize the fuel.  In fact, they would need
about half their available atmosphere to pressure the fuel tank up to
operating pressure.  They would also need a working fuel cell to run
the pump, so they need some of the near-empty fuel and oxyidizer
canisters.

T + 755 days

They try it and it works.  Alister refuels  the OTV from the tank
and returns to Icarus, where they repressurize their fuel system
and get the ship running again.  By now they are so close
to Earth orbit that they decide to go for a slingshot by
the planet, followed by orbital interface.

Alister had been seriously reading the Bible for the first time.
Along with the rest of the crew, he had been receiving plenty of email
from fundamentalists.  Most of the _Icarus_ crew deleted it along with
the rest of their junk mail.  Apparently Alister did not.

"Do you think we're living in the End Times?" he asked Andrea.  "What
do you have to do to be saved?"

Andrea pushed away the laptop she was working on.

"Well, first of all, I don't pretend to understand the book of
Revelation.  Beasts with seven heads, strange numerology...  People
attach all kinds of meanings to it.  But I'll tell you this.  Even a
cursory reading of Revelation shows that it's not about the end of the
world.  What happens at the end?"

"There's like a thousand years of peace, right?"

Andrea nodded an affirmative response.

"So at the very least, we can say that it's about a period in human
history torn by war, oppression, deceit and disaster, that ends with
the triumph of good.  So I don't even think about the End Times; I
know people call it that, but I think about Revelation as more like
the Transition Times."

"What do you have to do to make it through?"

"Well, that's the nice part.  Revelation doesn't tell us how to live;
the Gospels do that, and in fairly plain language, at least compared
to Revelation.  That's why I don't pay too much attention to
Revelation.  Maybe I should pay attention to it, but when I read the
Bible, it's usually the Gospels, because that's where Jesus tells us
how to live.  And the basic rules are pretty simple: Love God -
unconditionally, and love your fellow man - unconditionally.  And even
though that sounds easy, it can be really tough to figure it out in
practice.  I'm dealing with that right now."

"What do you mean?"

Andrea paused, then decided to go on.  Perhaps it was important
for the young man to know that she didn't always have all the answers,
and that just because you believed in Christ, you didn't always
know what was the right to do.

"Do you remember the day you met me, I arrived by cab?"

Alister nodded.

"The reason I arrived by cab was... was because I had picked
up a hitchhiker in the rental car I had gotten at the airport,
and...  he raped me and stole the car."

"What?" Alister asked, incredulous.  Andrea nodded.

"And that's not all.  After I came along on the mission, and started
getting my picture on TV, he started sending me emails.  Said he'd
hunt me down, that he'd come and get me."

Behind her, the captain had entered the compartment without being
seen.  He listened as the engineer continued her story.

"He thought he'd covered his tracks, that I couldn't figure out where
the emails had come from, but he didn't recon with Burns.  Before he
died, I asked him to track this guy down and he did.  I've got a file
full of a half-dozen emails, all tracked back to their source.  And I
don't know what to do with it.  Does forgiving your enemy mean just
dropping it and hitting the delete key?  What about other women he
might victimize?  Don't I have an obligation to them, too?"

Lou thumbed some papers on his desk and beat around the bush for
a minute.  He didn't quite know how to ask what he wanted to ask,
so finally he just blurt it out.

"I'm looking for a volunteer flight crew to pick up the _Icarus_ crew
and land the shuttle in Europe or somewhere."

The shuttle pilot and commander looked at each other, then back at the
STS program coordinator.  "This isn't approved by the director, is it
sir?"

"No."  Lou paused before continuing.  "You can say I gave you the
order to do..."

The commander interjected.  "You can't give us that kind of order,
sir.  We'd be court-martialed and thrown out of the space program,
probably the entire military."

An awkward silence fell over the room.  Breaking it, the pilot asked,
"Is this a favor for Andrea?"

Lou rubbed his hand over his balding scalp, noting the sweatiness of
both his head and his hands, and nodded in response, "Yeah".

"I'm in," he said, looking over at the shuttle commander.  Lou looked
up with surprise.  He had imagined this interview going much
differently.  Suddenly, he suddenly found himself outnumbering the Air
Force colonel, who looked back and forth between the administrator and
pilot before finally collapsing.

"Ah, what the hell.  I'm sick of this gig, anyway.  Mission
specialists have all the fun; all I do is command the thing!"

"What's the chance of them hijacking the shuttle, or something?"

The NASA chief looked at his two subordinates, who both answered
simultaneously.

"No, I don't think..."  "I think that's a definite..."

Becker continued first.

"It's a definite concern.  These guys aren't some bunch of space
tourists.  They know how to operate a spaceship, and their track
record shows the kind of things they're willing to do to get what they
want."

Lou spoke up next.

"I've known Andrea Yeats for almost 15 years, and there's no way she
would be involved with any kind of hijacking or anything of the kind.
No way."

"What if she isn't involved?  What if Mercurio and his crew just hijack
the thing without telling her anything?"

Lou shook his head.

"I don't think so.  She's part of that crew now.  After three years,
I don't think they'd make any major decision without involving her."

The director looked back at the two men standing across the desk from
him.  He took off his glasses and tossed them down on the desk.

"Well, the president said to bring them back, so bring them back.  I
just hope we get the damn shuttle down in one piece."

Vic: "What's going to happen to U.S, Marc?  I mean, really?"

Mercurio was silent for a minute.  Only the hum of the air conditioner
could be heard.  The doctor has blurt out the question that millions
of people had wondered at times, and much more recently since
September 11.

"Well, I don't for sure; I don't have a crystal ball or anything.  I
don't think it's going to change; the country seems absolutely
committed to capitalism, and it _is_ absolutely committed to
democracy."  He threw up his arms in an air of desperation, like a man
watching a ship full of drowning people helplessly from the shore.
"Hell, I hope I'm wrong.  I hope they can work out their problems."

"But you don't think they will."  It was more a statement than a
question, but the captain shook his head in response.

"No," he answered softly, then took a deep breath and exhaled.  "My
best guess is that its people'll just rip it apart from within.  It
keeps getting more and more violent, and the only solution the
democrats have is to keep cracking down harder and getting tougher.
Eventually the violence of its own people will destroy it.  That's my
best guess."

"Five."

"Four."

"Three."

"Two."

"One."

Alister's voice clipped off the final seconds, then the computer
began the insertion burn.  The slight force from the engine
pushed the crew gently backwards into their seats.  The
computer screen next to the engineer showed their current
tragectory, in blue, an open hyperbola that skittered out
off the screen, and their target tragectory, a neat red
circle centered on a green disk that represented Earth.
As the engines fired, the blue line began curving more
strongly back towards the direction they were coming from,
as another clock ticked down more seconds.

"Orbital interface in five, four, three, two, one, Earth orbit."

The blue line flicked neatly into a broad ellipse.  Alister breathed a
sigh of relief.  Almost nothing, short of something absurdly
catostraphic, like crashing into the atmosphere, could stop them from
getting back to Earth now.  Even the engine failed now, they would be
in some crazy orbit that the OTV's could get them down from no matter
what.

"ECO in five; four; three; two; one; Engine Cutoff."

The thrust stopped, just as the blue and red lines had merged into a
single yellow circle.  They were siting in a circular, six-hour
parking orbit above the heart of the African continent, clearly
visible through the OTV's portholes.

"Perfect burn," Alister declared, as he broke out into a wide
grin and let out a whoop.

In the next few days, the crew moved all their personal
belongings, along with anything they wanted to return with,
including gold from the asteroid belt, into OTV 2, secured everything
else they were leaving on the ship, and finally all piled into
the OTV and slipped away from the ship.  Firing the OTV's one
rocket, they dropped towards a rendevous with the partially
completed International Space Station.

"So, what's the plan?" Mercurio asked the shuttle commander and pilot.

"Basically, everything's fine until we deorbit about six hours before
we're supposed to, ignore mission control when they start hollering,
drop into the atmosphere off the Atlantic coast of Africa, contact
Dakar approach on the radio, declare an emergency, and land."

"Dakar?  Senegal?"

"Yep.  Supposed to have nice beaches.  We're gonna find out."

"And what happens to you guys?"

The two officers looked at each other before the pilot answered.

"We'll probably be court-martialed and run out of the space program;
I doubt we'll get any jail time, probably just dishonorable discharges."

The commander spoke up as he pulled the checklist back down in front
of him.

"I'm sick of flying these buckets anyway.  The mission specialists
have all the fun; all I do is command the thing!"

A few hours later, Mercurio gathered his crew in the shuttle's
main compartment.  He filled them in on the shuttle crew's
plan.

"They'll probably be court-martialed for it.  It'll end their careers,"
he concluded.  "I just can't ask them to do it."

Vic broke the silence that followed.

"So, it's Kennedy after all, then?"  Mercurio nodded in the affirmative.

"Look, if anyone doesn't want to do this, we'll go to Dakar.  I'll
say I hijacked the shuttle; hell, let's actually do it, then maybe
these guys'll have a chance of getting off."

The captain looked around the faces that surrounded him; the only
faces he'd seen in person for the last three years.  They were
his crew, his family, and he pretty much knew the answer each
would give in turn as they looked around the circle.

The doctor who started as a medical outcast and was now the world's
unquestioned expert on space medicine.

"Kennedy."

The young South African who'd grown up more in three years than most
men did in a lifetime.

"OK, Kennedy.  I hope that cop I punched out kinda forgot about me,"
he speculated wistfully.

Finally, the once unheralded NASA engineer who'd become a flashpoint
in her own right for her strongly held unorthodox opinions.

"Kennedy."

The captain concluded the unanimous decision as the shuttle crew
floated down from the PMA.

"Colonel, we've been talking, and we just can't ask you to go
to Senegal.  We want you to take us to Kennedy."

The two NASA men looked at each other, and the pilot spoke first.

"Sir, we volunteered for this mission."

"I know, and I thank you.  But you're not throwing your careers away
for us.  Take us to Kennedy."

The NASA men looked at each other, and the pilot spoke for both of them.

"Well, we'll take you where ever you want to go."

"Kennedy," the Captain said with an air of finality.

The shuttle commander looked around the cramped compartment.  Each
Icarus crewman nodded assent.

"Ok, Kennedy it is.  Are we ready to close the hatches?"

The space station crew above gave an affirmative reply.  As they
closed the PMA's hatch, the Captain turned back to his crew.

"Let's go home."


EPILOG

"It's good to have you guys back."

"It's good to be back."

"There's something I've been meaning to ask you, but you were dead by
the time it happened.  What went wrong with _Columbia_?"

"Well, for starters we some repeat patterns with _Challenger_.  Again
we see the first indications of the problem are visual.  Again we find
NASA glued to their instruments, which actually do show something
wrong this time.  But again there's no contingency plan.  Again,
nobody seems to have really thought SRB Sep, or in this case just
level off your descent.  If the thing can't fly straight and level at
Mach 18, it's a design flaw."

"Well, the tiles have been an issue since the beginning," Vic chimed in.

"The vehicle is old," Andrea concluded, "the technology has moved
ahead.  It's time to really look at the kind of technique Burns used
to build the engines of the _Icarus_.  Can you just cast the entire
shuttle out of heat shield material and leave it hollow in the middle?"

"We shouldn't even be trying," Mercuriou spoke again.  "Our problems
are hear on this planet.  That was one of my biggest mistakes.  It's
absurd to think we're going to fix our problems here on Earth by
flying off to Mars."

"No argument here," Vic said emphatically.

"If people want to fly to Mars, let them," Andrea exclaimed, throwing
her right arm up in exasburation.  Bits of seseme seed went flying
from her knife.  "Haven't I gotten anything through to you, yet?  Let
people do want to they want to do, and try to help them out.  Feed
them.  Give them a place to stay and a place to work.  Something like
manned spaceflight is going to need a lot of people helping out, too."

"Well that's the real issue," Vic chimed in, changing thoughts in
mid-sentence.  "Who's going to make that decision, some big government
agency?"

"Hopefully the people themselves who are asked to help out," Andrea
replied.  "The farmer asked for food.  If all he wants to know is if
you've got money to pay for it, then we're going to keep having
problems.  The principle is you _give_to_all_those_who_beg_of_you_,
and when you can't do that, you make some more sensible decision than
just give to those who've got money and the rest go without."

...

At first, the astronaut said nothing, and the reflected glare of
sunlight on his visor precluded any attempt to read his facial
expression.  Clearly visible on his right shoulder, however, was the
green, red, blue and black design of the South African flag.

			===========

"Now in addition to yourself and Dr. Antanov, you also have your engineer,
Burns, and at least one other astronaut, is that right?"

"Yes, we have two other astronauts.  Alister Compton is the assistant
engineer, and Dr. Andrea Yeats, of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, has volunteered to lend her expertise to our mission.
I guess you could call her an observer."

In Houston, Lou was watching the broadcast from a conference room in
the Johnston Space Flight Center, where an entire floor of a building
had now been dedicated to monitoring the flight of the _Icaraus_.  A
number of people exhaled loudly and began chattering amongst
themselves as soon as Mercuriou had mentioned Yeats' name.  Someone
picked up a contingency plan that had been rapidly developed and
flipped down several pages, to one entitled "Captain invokes volunteer
status".  Lou stood silently watching the broadcast for a few more
seconds, until a phone rang and it was handed to him.

--- The Next Day (maybe) ---

"Dr. Yeats has not been kidnapped.  She has made that very clear
to us in our communications with her.  She insists that she was
given the opportunity to leave and elected to stay in order to
help these people."

Lou Becker's news conference was being carried live on national
television.  It was the first official statement from a NASA official
that mentioned Yeats, and the first that had received any kind of
serious press attention.  After each of his remarks, several reporters
would all try to interrupt with a question simultaneously, and
Becker had to make a conscientious effort to control the situation
and pick one question to hear and answer.  Though not his first
press conference, it was his first under this degree of scrutiny,
and he was somewhat nervious.  It didn't show.

"OK, Mary," he stated firmly, pointing to one of the reporters that
usually covered the NASA beat, and tending to avoid the glut of
strange faces that had suddenly crowded into the usually sedate press
room.

"Does Dr. Yeats support these people?  And is she acting in any
kind of official role?"

"No, I don't want to put words in her mouth, but I don't think she
supports them so much as she is willing to help them.  Those of you
that know her, understand that she's a very kind person and very
willing to help even those she doesn't agree with.  As for an offical
role, she was acting in an official role, but her decision to
volunteer for this mission was strictly personal, and it remains to be
decided by NASA if her role on the _Icarus_ is as an offical
observer."

"Why didn't NASA immediately come forward with the admission that a
veteran astronaut was involved in this caper?"

The question came from a political correspondent who had learned to
carefully note a speaker's tone of voice and body language, and loudly
injected his voice at the end of the response before anyone else could
nose in.  Lou pulled out a canned response he had prepared in advance.

"Well, frankly, because of questions like that!  This thing has become
a media circus that's on T.V. night and day, and we wanted to take
the time to try and get the answers to these questions, such as
how Dr. Yeats came to be on board the _Icarus_, and whether this
is an offical NASA role, and how _she_ wants the situation dealt with,
and frankly, I'm glad we've had two days to talk about this amongst
ourselves without trying to ask and answer these questions all at
the same time with the glare of the T.V. cameras on."

"So, basically, you've been trying to decide how to spin it."

"No, I think that's _your_ speciality, and let me now take a question
from over here."

"Dr. Becker, it sounds to me like Dr. Yeats was basically kidnapped
and somehow convinced to join up with these people, I mean, you know,
Patricia Hurst and the Mansons, it's not uncommon for kidnap victims
to identify with their captors."

"Look, Andrea Yeats arrived at their launch site less than two days
before they lifted off, certainly not long enough for her to be
brainwashed, which is what that question rather implies.  If anything,
her presence there threw a major kind in their plans, and you'd just
have to know Andrea to appreciate that she's not going to be coerced
by anyone to do anything she doesn't want to."



--------

"For example, you proposed a twenty-first century library of
Alexandria at one point, right, Captain?"

Mercuriou nodded in silent agreement.

"And you couldn't really answer who was going to pay for it, right?
Well, the Christian answer is that the authors pay for it.  They write
the books, publish them on the Internet, give copies freely to anyone
who wants them whether they pay or not, and end up homeless and
starving on the streets, because most people will just take whatever
they can get for free, but you better believe that the shopkeepers and
the restaurants and the landlords aren't going to just 'give to all'.
That's what happens to Christians in this world."


------

"This isn't Christianity!  Christianity is about redemption through
faith.  You're redeemed through faith, not through your deeds!"

"If that's so, then why does Jesus spend so much time talking about
how we live in this world?  Why did he bother to say 'turn the other
cheek' and 'give to all those who beg of you' and 'if a man steals
your cloak, give him your cloak as well'?  Yes, he talks about faith,
but he talks about deeds, too, and if deeds aren't important, why does
he spend so much time discussing them?"


-----



------

"Because we've got other things we need the money for."

"Like what?"

"Like your tenderloin, so eat it," Burns cut in, reaching across the
table with his knife and tapping the South African's plate for emphasis.

"No!" the man stated emphatically, pushing the plate away from him.
"You guys are up to something, and it's not legal..."

"Keep your voice down," Mercurio growled.

"OK," Alister began again in a near whisper.  "Whatever you blokes
are up to, there's no way it's above board."

-----

A "red alert" simply meant that they were now within one month of
launch, a final countdown.  The plan called for almost all of their
operations to be shifted to the location know as Site Blue.  Mercurio
insisted that the equipment at Robotics Research be packed and shipped
within twenty-four hours.  Burn's kids worked through the night and
were gone by 7 A.M.  Mercurio left a simple, typewritten notice taped
to the door:

   From:  Marcelius Mercurio, CEO, Robotics Research, Ltd
   To:    Lawyers
          Financiers
          Bankers

   Gentlemen,

      Your services are no longer required.

"Well, we keep hearing about what if you can't produce enought?"

"Well, the software industry at least has shown us what a lie that one
is.  There's no cost to produce.  They could stick all their stuff on
the Interent, source code and all, for next to nothing.  Just set up
and maintain a web presence.  On the other hand, there's a huge amount
of extra effort that goes into putting all these controls and
restrictions in place to get money.  Who knows about other fields
of industry, but clearly in the software industry, the cost
of production would be a lot less without capitalism!"

----

They sped across the desert mesa towards the last rocket, police cars
with screaming sirens right behind.  Both police and news helicopters
hovered overhead, and the images were now being carried live on
practically every TV station in the country, as well as some in
Europe.  Stopping the jeep at the base of the rocket, they jumped
into the cable car and started the winch.  The police cars pulled up
at the base and the cops ran to the base of the tower, but the car
was already out of reach.

"If you want to stick around when we fire this thing up, be my guest!"
Marc yelled down to them, motioning towards the mamouth ICBM they
were now inching up.  At the top, Marc and Brian walked across the
catwalk and climbed into the cockpit.  Marc pulled the hatch shut
behind them and sealed it.  They had checked the radio earlier, and
Marc now clicked it on and called Burns.  He knew they didn't have
time for long checklists.

"We're ready to go."

One of the cops said something on his radio, then they all got in
their cars and headed back towards the compound.  "This is out of our
league; call for the feds," one of them told his partner.  Halfway
across the mesa, the ground shook as the solid fuel ignited in the
rocket behind them.

-----

"OK, this is A-core," Burns announced as he led Andrea into the first
cargo module past the 747.  "It's basically a backup command center.
It might become our command center in time."  Much of A-core was still
in packing boxes secured to the walls of the module.  Some things had
been unpacked, however, most notably an enormous flat-panel LCD
screen, considerably bigger than a conventional TV, which had been
installed against one wall and was now lit with a standard computer
status display, showing the ship's position in its orbit, their a
ground track, and a radar composite two hundred kilometers to either
side of the ship, showing the various cargo modules.  This image,
unlike the others, appeared blurry at first, since it was actually two
images alternated rapidly with each other and designed to be viewed
with 3-D glasses.  The far side of A-core was almost empty.  To this
far side, and the pressure door there, Burns led Andrea.

"There is no other A-module, because there's nothing else docked to
A-node," Burns said, passing through the pressure door into a docking
node with four empty ports, their portholes showing only star fields
and, in one, a spectacular view of Australia.  Only one door directly
across from A-core was occupied, not surprisingly, but a cargo module
Burns called B-core.  Andrea closed the pressure door behind her as
Burns opened the one in front of him.

B-core was almost completely empty.  Burns explained as he propelled
himself across it that it was intended, like the far end of A-core, as
a staging and work area for any modules that might be temporally
docked to the A-node.  Past B-core was B-node, but this one was fully
occupied with docked modules.

"These are the crew quarters, Doctor, we've each got one of these;
well, I don't know about you.  I'm in B-2, the captain's in B-1,"
Burns said, pointing to pressure doors around him as he spoke,
"Alister's got B-3, and the doc's in B-4.  I don't know where we'll
put you, but let's take a look at C-core."

C-core was intended as a crew lounge.  Stowed here in boxes was
exercise equipment, more computers and TV panels, all of it yet
untouched.

C-1: sickbay storage
C-2: sickbay
C-3: electronics lab
C-4: chemistry lab

"That's the problem with being smart.  The smarter you get, the more

Andrea made a conscious effort to be constructive.  "Democracy isn't
magic.  It's a system of government where the majority of people choose
their own leaders.  If they choose well, it succeeds.  If they choose
poorly..."  Her voice drifted off into silence; the humming of the
air conditioners was the only sound for many seconds.

----

"After the Soviet Union collapsed, we saw the truth about democracy.
The U.S. was left as the world's only superpower, and could really
have done something to make all this talk about liberty and freedom
real.  Instead, they built a wall across their southern border,
declared war on their own people, and decided to keep all their
technology secret and controlled so they could make billions off it
for themselves.  That's when we really saw the truth about democracy."

Big government was in.  A national newsmagazine aired a segment
featuring an interview with a woman who said, "I just assumed if there
was a problem, there'd be a law in place to deal with it."

"Now why would you assume that?"  Mercuriou asked the TV screen
as he watched the program.  "Why would you assume that for _every_
problem we've got, the solution is another law?"

"I know people who don't wear their seatbelts," Andrea said.  Car
safety was the topic of the broadcast.  "They prefer to say a prayer
when they get in the car instead of putting on their seatbelts."

"Exactly!" Mercuriou exclaimed.  "Now who the hell is the great
_majority_ to tell someone that they can't do that; that they
can't decide for themselves to wear that seatbelt or not?"

"I'll tell you why," he went on.  "It's not only because the majority
has no real respect for anyone else, not only because once they've
made a decision for themselves they can see no reason not to impose it
on others, but the simple fact is _they've_got_no_other_solutions_.
The only way they know how to deal with _any_ problem they've got is
more laws, more rules, more regulations.  It's inconsivable to them to
find real solutions to their problems!  They choose absolute garbage
for their leaders, and then when they've got problems, and you better
beleive that a society run by capitalists, or communists, or fascists
is going to have problems, their 'solutions' are always the same - get
tough.  They can't figure out that they need to choose good leaders in
the first place, and that the answer to every problem isn't some new
law."

"I'll tell you why," he went on.  "It's not only because the majority
has no real respect for anyone else, not only because once they've
made a decision for themselves they can see no reason not to impose it
on others, but the simple fact is _democracy_defines_right_and_wrong_!
These people have no conception of how to behave except what is
defined by the government!  What's right is what's legal, what's wrong
is what's illegal, and there's nothing else!  There's no point at
which the majority can conceive that something that is wrong wouldn't
be prohibited by a law!  It's just completely beyond these people that
the force of government should be used to absolute minimum and that
people have to ask themselves what is right and wrong!  Democracy
makes all these decisions for you!"

----

"Well, that's a hobby."

"A hobby?"

"A hobby.  Something you do in your spare time.  A job is what you
do to put food on the table."

"OK, so let me get this straight.  A job is whatever you do that
produces food, and anything else is a hobby.  You forgot to add that
this 'job' involves dumping the forty hours a week for the best years
of your life into working for some system run by the most selfish
bastards you'd ever want to meet in your life."

----

"Capitalism is one of the most utterly immoral philosophies that
has even been proposed for men to live their lifes."

----

"These people that just don't want to work..."

"That's right!  For you and your nightmare system and your
ruthless capitalist leaders, you're damn right I don't want to work!"

----


...

"How much money did you steal?"

"Hard to say.  Adding up everything we lied about, everything we
bought on empty credit, everything we just flat out stole - probably
close to a billion dollars."  He paused for a minute.  "And that's a
shoestring budget for what we're trying to do.  We've cut a lot of
corners.  A billion isn't much for a manned space launch, let alone
one going to Mars."

"How many corners did you cut?"

"A bunch.  I'd like to have three identical ships going, but we've
only got one.  We don't have any kind of landing vehicle yet, and
of course I'd like to have one built already and tested here on Earth,
but that isn't going to happen either."

"How do you plan to land on Mars if you don't have a landing vehicle?"

"We've got an old 747 we managed to put in orbit this morning, and
I'm hoping we can modify it to function as a space shuttle."

"How much do you have of... uh, supplies?"

"We've got a year's supply of food, water, charcoal to extract carbon
dioxide from the air.  Then we'll have to start recycling."

"Do you expect to be gone longer than a year?"

"Of course, yes.  There's no way we could get to Mars and back in a
year.  Plus, I'm planning on making a stop at the astroid belt on the
way.  I'm looking at five years..."

"And who's going to pay for it, Captain, who's going to pay for it?"

#elsif 2

"Well, that sounds very noble, Captain, but in the real world, if you
just give everything away, you'll be put out of business."

"That's right!  That's the 'freedom' of capitalism right there - you be
a capitalist or you'll be put out of business.  And then if you won't
work for these bums, you'll be put homeless and starving on the street
and all these great, decent people will spit on you as they walk past
and call you a bum who doesn't want to work... And they're right,
'cause I don't want to work - not for them and not for their brutal
system!"

#elsif 3

"And who's going to pay for it, Captain, who's going to pay for this
library of Alexandria once we just give all these books away for
free?"

"Maybe the capitalists could pay for it, Congressman, they've
certainly got the money."

"I know, I know, take from the rich and give to the poor.  We've heard
all this before!  It's been rejected by the people."

"Again, Congressman, I don't have some big plan to figure how to pay
for it, but I know that our leaders aren't even trying.  They're
determined that it won't happen.  They're determined that all this
information will be controlled, just like everything else in a
capitalist society.  Everything is controlled by the capitalist
system."

The paradox of freedom: how do you give freedom to both the Nazis and the Jews?

----

"Drug addiction, alcoholism, thirty thousand suicides a year, clinical
depression at near epidemic proportions... and it's all because of
some guys sitting on their couches smoking dope, right?  Couldn't have
anything to do with your leaders, ehh?  Couldn't be because you're
raised from childhood to be a little cog in this capitalist system,
that you're basically forced to work because the capitalists control
everything, and the people you're forced to work for are the most
selfish bums you'd ever want to meet in your life.  Couldn't have
anything to do with your problems, right?  Couldn't be
_the_people_in_charge_of_your_society_ that are responsible for any
of this?"

----

"Yet people believe that if they've got money in their hands,
they've got freedom.  They absolutely insist that they _aren't_
living off the clerk stocking the shelfs at Safeway, only because
they sit behind some desk pushing paper and some corporation
cuts them a check every other Friday."

----

"Vic had really good points.  We live in a world where individuals
are dependent on society to an almost unprecidented degree, and
that's not a good thing.  Then you compound this with the majority's
total inability to choose good leaders."

"Burns once proposed a telephone system based totally on a wireless
network - all the phones interoperate over digital radio links using a
routing protocol to figure how you hop from phone to phone to phone to
get your call through.  This is the kind of technology you want -
technology that's decentralized, that doesn't require a massive
infrastructure, that's open and non-proprietary so that anyone can
build a telephone to interoperate with the system.  But the
capitalists don't want this.  They want a telephone system that's
centralized and controlled, so that there's a switch on every single
phone line and if you don't pay your bill at the end of the month,
your service gets disconnected.  They want centralized, controlled
technology, because that's how you get money out of people.  If the
phones just work on some open protocol, if you can't switch the
service off from some centralized location, then you can't make money
off of it, so that means you go nowhere in this society - no
engineers, no circuit boards, no manufacturing plants.  Capitalism is
totally rigged against exactly the kind of technological change this
planet so desperately needs."

----

"All this is true, but again, the most serious problems are spiritual
and not political or technological.  As long as people are willing to
stand behind their counters and refuse to serve a hamburger unless
they're getting money, you're going to have these problems.  It's a
bottom up proposition.  If people can't eat without money, it's
pointless to talk about building some hi-tech system without money.
You've got Christ there telling you 'give to all those who beg off
you' and the masses of people just don't want to hear it.  They refuse
to believe that he was talking to _you_, in _your_ business, standing
there behind _your_ counter.  They didn't want to hear it two thousand
years ago, and they don't want to hear it today."


----

"As far as I'm concerned, you're just a bum who doesn't want to work!"

Mercuriou laughed.

"Sure, that's why I'm sitting up here in orbit, that's how we
developed this fuel technology, that's why the dictionary publisher
wanted to market the Greek reading aid - we're just lazy bums who
don't want to work!"

"It's just propaganda!  In Russia, anyone who opposed communism was a
counter-revolutionary; in Germany, anyone who opposed fascism was a
Jew; here, anyone who opposes capitalism is a bum who doesn't want to
work.  Notice how you don't want to discuss capitalism; notice how
quickly the discussion gets turned into a personal assault on Marc
Mercuriou's personal work ethic; you don't want to discuss capitalism,
you want to turn the whole thing into a personal character attack, and
this is one of the hallmarks of propaganda - turn the discussion away
from the real issues, make it into a personal character assault on
your opponent, put him on the defensive."


-----
idiot routing protocol.  It's just boring, and I always had managers
pushing me to do more and more and more.  If anything, Marc pushes me
to do less and less.  He'll offload anything he can.  And Alister was
a great find.  He's a lot of fun to work with, and a lot of stuff I'm
sick of fooling with, he'll jump into.  Marc hired him, of course."

The federal detective showed Andrea his identification papers.

"Ever heard of Keystone Securities?"

She started to shake her head, then stopped.  "Isn't that
the company that went bankrupt?"

He nodded.

"There's some kind of investigation into that right?"

Again he nodded.

"You're part of it?"

For the third time, a nod in response, followed by an explaination.

"Keystone's operation was heavily computerized.  Their computers
malfunctioned and traded away a little over a billion dollars
in securities in less than a day."

"A bug?" Andrea wondered aloud.  The agent shook his head.

"A virus would be closer to the truth.  They were hacked, we're still
not exactly sure how, but we've found the critical section of code
that was modified in their trading system."

Andrea knitted her brow.

"Well, if that's true, then the transactions were illegal, right?"

Again the agent nodded.

"So why can't you just reverse them and get the money back, you
should even be able to track down who it went to."

The agent smiled.

"That's the beauty of this thing.  The transactions went to hundreds
of different accounts, spread over three major banks - WorldBank, Bank
Deutsch, and Allenby's of London."

[hopefully, none of these companies actually exist!]

"And?"

"And none of the banks have any record of the transactions!"

Again Andrea was puzzled.

"So the transactions never occured?"

"Oh, they occured.  The exchange recorded them, and the books won't
balance without them."

A silence pervaded the room for a minute.

"So how can there be no record of the transactions, I mean, I'm no
banking expert, but..."  She let her voice trail off.

"Dr. Yeats," the fed continued, "a detective far more famous than
I once said that when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains,
however improbable..."

"...must be the truth," Yeats finished his sentence for him.  "I've
read Sherlock Holmes, too.  So what's your impossible, or improbable
truth, and how does it relate to N-1033?"

"The impossible truth, Dr. Yeats, the only possible way I can account
for the evidence I've got, is that not only was Keystone hacked, but
so was WorldBank, Bank Deutsch, and Allenby's.  All four computer
systems were party to this theft."  He paused for a moment to let this
set in.

"And the relationship to N-1033," he continued, "is simply this.  Do
you believe, from what you've read, that N-1033 could have been
developed without the source code to _Gaussian_?"

Andrea leaned back in her chair and thought for a moment.  Finally,
the conversation had turned to a subject she more or less understood.

"No," she said after a moment, "didn't they parallize the system
themselves?"  Lou nodded.  "And their handling of the liquid state
dynamics... did the _Gaussian_ team do that for them?"

Lou's response was negative.

"No, Andrea, they did it all themselves.  And the manufacturer says
they never provided them with the source code, in fact, that it's
their policy not to release source code to customers, they only get
binaries."

"In short, Dr. Yeats," the agent now concluded, "the most likely
way XXX got the source code to _Gaussian_ was a hack."

----

"The difference between capitalism and those other system is
_individual_freedom_.  You can be a capitalist if you choose, you can
be social worker if you choose, you can be an author, you can be a
doctor; it's nothing imposed by the government."

"Well, that's great to hear, Congressman, because I want to be a
librarian!  I got a couple thousand books here in my ship's library,
all electronic, and I've been thinking about putting them up on the
Internet!"

"Stolen books," the congressman dryly noted.  "We've all heard about
your library, captain."

"Stolen books!" the astronaut practically spit the words back.  "You
mean stolen 'intellectual property', don't you?"

"It's the same thing.  Theft is theft."

"No, congressman, it's not the same thing.  Theft is physically taking
something that belongs to someone else.  A book, a physical book _can_
be stolen and we stole plenty, you better believe it, but the
information it contains can not."

"Well, we've pretty decisively rejected that idea in this society.
Information _does_ have value, captain, as you very well know,
and it _can_ be stolen, as so much of your entire 'mission' shows."

"That's right, and it just gauls the hell out of you that someone
could steal everything they need to fly into space!  Not just the
information, but the billions and billions of little dollar signs in
your computers that tell your robot workers, 'ok, you can give this
guy anything he asks for', right?"

"'Captain', the fact remains that you are a thief, OK?  A glorified,
glamorized, attension-grabbing thief.  The people who have written
those books have the right to decide what happens to their work, and I
keep telling you, because we have _free_dom!"

"You know, I am so sick of hearing about people's 'rights'!  Whenever
I hear that word 'rights', the next thing I start figuring is 'who's
getting screwed'."  Ecks started to cut in, but Mercuriou wouldn't let
him.  "People always talk about their 'rights' when they want to jam
somebody else's face in the mud.  Your bum leaders want to build an
'information economy', where knowledge is just one more commodity to
bought and sold, and the only way people will pay for it is if it's
kept secret."  Now the space captain morphed sarcastic.  "They talk
about their 'rights'!  They've got the 'right' to keep that
information secret, just the great people's government in Russia did!
And copying books online is illegal for the same reason that
photocopiers and fax machines were illegal in the Soviet Union, or at
least heavily controlled - " Now he slowed dramatically to make this
point.  "The potential of the technology represents too great a threat
to the system's ability to control people's lives."

Ecks waited a bit longer, then returned to a common theme.

"Captain, again, those people have the right to decide what happens to
_their_ work, simply because it is _their_ work.  The authors, they
could decide to put it online like you suggest, they have that
_freedom_."

"Just because you have freedom doesn't turn wrong into right..."

Now it was Ecks' turn to bust in laughing.

"Yes, Captain, it doesn't turn wrong into right, you are still a
_thief_!"

Mercuriou reddened and angered.

"That's right, that what you've got to be to make it in capitalism.
One way or another.  You've got to learn to be a ruthless,
self-serving, money-grubbing bum.  And whether you steal to do it, or
just ride roughshod over the rest of humanity with some nightmare
system."

"Communism made a lot of sense - 'class warfare', I mean, look around.
A bunch of people trying to make money off publishing books pushing
the government for all these legal restrictions, the high-school kid
who can't afford the music he wants copying it anyway.  The 'haves'
verses the 'have nots'.  How could it not make sense?  It's the story
of human nature - the rich man and the thief.  Communism tells the
thieves that their theft was justified, that they had been oppressed,
that they could have a people's revolution and expropriate the
expropriators.  Capitalism tells the rich man that his wealth is
justified, that it's his 'right' to decide how it gets spent, that all
these people gripping about it could just go get a job and make the
money they keep begging for.

"Christianity, of course, refuses to justify either man.  God tells
the thief, 'thou shall not steal', and Christ tells the rich man 'if a
thief steals your coat, give him your cloak as well'.  So to put that
in a modern context, if a man breaks into your house, holds you and
your family up at gunpoint, takes everything of value that he sees,
you give him the keys to the car and offer to help carry the stereo
out, because it's pretty heavy."

Laughter.

"Well, you laugh because people just don't want to hear it, but that
_is_ what Jesus said.  He also told the thief some things he doesn't
want to hear, either.  In fact, even your majority don't want to hear
it.  Despite all your condemnation of Communism, you still keep trying
to glorify your own revolution.  You keep trying to tell us George
Washington and Thomas Jefferson were justified in an armed revolution
against the British crown.  Yet Christ tells us in the garden to
sheath our swords.  The oppressed are not justified in theft, and they
are not justified in revolution.  If people would live both sides of
that equation, if the 'haves' would give to anyone who begged of them,
and the 'have-nots' would accept whoever was in power, things would
tend to work out.  But the 'haves' always abuse their power, and the
'have-nots' always scream for revolution.  For a democratic
revolution, if they are sufficiently localized geographically to be
able to control one, because democracy really 'legimitizes' it.  If
all the drugs users in the United States were completely localized in
one state, that they could easily control the state government through
democratic elections, you'd see a much different drug policy in the
United States.  I can't tell you exactly what it'd be, but I can tell
you that the dissident groups that get oppressed most in democracy are
the ones that are so broadly spread geographically that they can't
influence even local elections."

"What changed in nine-eleven is this majority finally figured out that
all the billions they've blown on weapons, weapons, and more weapons,
hasn't had then _untouchable_.  Nine-eleven was just like the scene in
the movie, written in blood on the wall: 'touchable'.  That's why we
hear all this crying now about weapons of mass destruction, because
these are the _only_ weapons that can really target THE MAJORITY.

"Who else you gonna attack?  Who else is really guity?  It's the
people who keep voting militant capitalists back into power, keeping
working for their corporations, keep supporting their system - in a
word, the majority."

"What do you mean by mititant capitalism, you've used the phrase
several times."

"Well, first of all capitalists, men and women who subcribe this
pseudo-religion of greed, that you've got this whole battery of goods
and services you offer, but nobody gets any of it without money, and
secondly militants, people who sit around at cocktail parties and say,
"Man, that technology worked great in Iraq!" and marvel at tanks that
can fire twice as far as any other and do it at forty miles per hour,
people who insist that we've _got_ to have those weapons, to protect
our _freedom_, you know, _militant_capitalists_, or in other words,
_the_majority_.

"Do I 'beilive' in democracy?  No.  I mean, do I believe that it
exists, sure!  Do I believe that it's the
greatest-system-of-government- ever-invented-by-man(TM), no.  Do I
believe that it can consistently produce decent leadership, no.  Do I
believe that there's a snowball's chance in hell that it won't be
remembered as one of the most hated systems of government ever...
maybe."

"Well, the fact is that people will follow selfish and violent leaders
- this has been demonstrated time and time again, from the French
Revolution forward."

"You keep saying the French Revolution, what about the American?"

"Well, the nice thing about the French Revolution was that it came to
pieces so quickly - you could directly see what'd you'd get from a
democracy.  It took the American Revolution another two hundred years
to conjuer and annex northern Mexico, rip itself to pieces in the
Civil War, exterminate native Indian society, and generally unlease
capitalism on the planet after it had muddled through fascism and
communism."

In 1848, based almost entirely on his name recognizition, the French

Vic: "Well, I don't reject technology outright, but I certainly think
we've got a serious, serious problem with industrialization and the
consequent de-humanization of labor on the assembly line.  In the
twentieth century, we've seen the emergence of labor unions and the
general success of the labor movement to gain improvements in working
conditions through both legislation and contract negotiation.  Yet
those gains are largely confined to the West, and we've also seen
factories essentially exported to third-world nations that don't have
strong labor movements in order to avoid the high costs of labor in
the West.  One thing you don't see is an _international_ labor
movement; labor unions are typically local or national institutions
that are perfectly willing to sacrifice the interests of foreign
workers in order to protect their own; thus you see labor leaders
advocating restrictive immigration policies, for example, while
basically turning a blind eye to the working conditions in those
countries."

"So what's the point?"

"Well, the point is that despite all the much publicized successes of
labor we've still got serious problems with industrialization."

"But hasn't the world gone post-industrial?"

"No, it hasn't.  We still use industrial processes to manufactuer our
cars, our appliances, our food, the concrete, the steel, the plastic
that so much of our society depends on.  The hype and the money has
gone post-industrial, but there's still a lot of people working on
assembly lines in Middle America, and getting a computer certification
so you can quit your job when the factory moves to Thailand isn't the
answer."

"So what is the answer?"

"Well, I think a lot of the answer is technological.  I'm a firm
believer that we need technological solutions to our technological
problems, political solutions to our political problems, and spiritual
solutions to our spiritual problems.  It doesn't do any good to try
and find political solutions to technological problems.  The robotics
technology that we're using to grow our food here has a lot of
potential.  Basically, we can think now about replacing our assembly
line workers with robots.  But we can't do that if replacing the
workers means putting them homeless and jobless on the streets!"
