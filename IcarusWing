	    Requirements for The Great anti-American Novel



T - 691 days    crime must pay

It was a brilliant hack.  It topped the one
in college, when the net-news server was
configured to refuse the student lab.
They'd recompiled the server, altered so
that after printing ACCESS 5 DENIED
the program would accept posts anyway,
went in as "root", dropped the raw binary
straight to the drive, and used it daily for
six months until the system staff updated
the whole install.  But then they were just kids.

Burns parked in the employee lot, behind
the water fountain's dancing white froth display
and meter-high "Chesapeake," the k's
back cast like a sailboat's mast, and its whole visage that
of whitecaps breaking on the bay.
Chesapeake Computer Corporation:
world's largest router manufacturer,
A-list stock darling of the dot-com-ers,
high priesthood of the Internet who built
sleek metal semaphores humming away
on backroom metal racks of ISPs
around the world, that same one-word logo
emblazoned on the case of every one.

Fashionably bearded, Burns wore dot-com standard: blue jeans, sandals,
and a T-shirt emblazened with the Generalized Stokes Theorem in its
most abstract form. "You wouldn't understand," the caption read, "it's
a MATH 462 thing."

He strolled into the lobby like a favorite son
into his father's restaurant, breezed
past the rock garden and the potted palms,
blew off the break room, its Phillie cream cheese
bagels and stocked 'fridge, jogged right at the conference rooms
and entered a two-story cave
partitioned by a hundred cubicles ---
his life, ten hours a day the last six months.
These steel and fabric walls held Chesapeake's
true wealth, the coddled technocrats who built
the company's flagship products from caffeine
and white-board markers.  Wisely management
consigned itself across the street.

The key card was real; Burns was totally
legit.  A roaring economic boom
kept restaurants, book stores, golf courses and concert halls
jam packed with twenty-somethings who
had never flown economy in their
lives.  Every other car on College Avenue
was a Mercedes, or a BMW,
or a Land Rover.  Chic
restaurateurs provided their patrons colored Crayons and
blank paper place-mats to
brainstorm slick new proprietary server architectures while
waiting for twenty dollar lunches.  Programmers
were hot, and Burns' qualifications made
him a genuine find.
A white board talk was his job interview;
the background check, his resume.
He quickly got the run of Chesapeake,
concerned far more with the next million-dollar order than
deploying any real security against an inside hack.

Today, the cubicles were largely deserted.  As
he slipped into his, an attractive femme
in 'business casual' race-walked past.
A product specialist skilled in trade show acronyms,
Samantha Pride was always ready to
remind `her' programmers of the obvious.
When Burns had quit this job, he would not miss
_Big_talk_today,_Burns_, or
_Cable's_loose,_Burns_, or

"System goes down today, Burns!"

Burns: "Wouldn't miss it for judgment day."

He pushed back his chair, bit back his anxiety and logged in.  The
main development computer, scheduled for a hardware upgrade, would be
shut down in less than an hour.  His e-mails, mostly notes from
various employees turning the day's outage into an excuse for a
holiday weekend, offered no reason to change plans.  He logged out,
shouldered his laptop case and headed for the server room.

Back in the nineteen seventies, those halcyon days when spam came in
cans and porn sites were on Gay Street, Brian Kernighan, inventor of
UNIX, demonstrated that a compiler could covertly alter the programs
it compiled, including itself, and who would write a compiler without
having a compiler already?  A Kerninghan virus is particularly
effective on closed, heavily customized systems, like those of a
router manufacture wanting custom, proprietary software to take
advantage of custom, proprietary hardware.

Burns slid his key card through the slotted box.  A light turned
green; a bolt clicked back; a line printer rattled.  Above an elevated
floor that covered a halon fire extinguisher system were
floor-to-ceiling arrays loaded with switch hubs, firewalls, RAID
arrays, and, in the corner, a massive air conditioner plant to
dissipate the heat.  A brand new multi-processor system sat, unpowered
and silent, while several workers chatted leisurely amongst themselves,
including one sporting a shock of red hair.

"Hey, Burns, what's up?"

'Red' Rimdew specialized in diving into stalled projects and finishing
them by pounding out code.  Burns, really more a designer than a
programmer, respected Red for his staying power with the boring tedium
that the finicky machines imposed on their masters.  Yet today no
deadlines loomed...

"Want to hit the bay?"

An afternoon of sailing on Red's thirty-six-foot Catalan
was an enticing idea, but Burns thought first
of the weeks
spent designing and writing his laptop's "screensaver";
the hours spent drilling 
dozens of variants on a thirty-second procedure; the flowcharted contingency
plans on an encrypted hard drive; his roommate waiting at the
apartment with a network link and two phone lines.

Burns: "No, thanks.  I gotta get this done."

He crossed to the other side of the room, where he was working on a
tricky install in one of the test machines.  Somehow, he just couldn't
seem to get the settings right.  Once set up, he emailed his roommate,
_How_about_lunch_? _Sounds_fine,_ came Mercuriou's reply.

Forty five minutes later, with the main system shut down and two of
the three techs out of the room, Burns sent another email,
_Let's_try_Bogart's_.  Back in the apartment, Mercuriou skimmed down a
list of local restaurants and the names they translated into, then
picked up the phone.  A minute later, the third tech was called out to
answer a phone call.  Burns had contemplated taking a shot of
J.D. that morning to steal himself for this moment, but decided that
he had to be absolutely sober in case _anything_ went wrong.

He dashed across the room as the door closed.  It was one of the
scenarios he had drilled for.  He connected two cables, hit a
three-key sequence on the laptop, and ventured a glance at the door.
Nobody.  The laptop beeped.  He disconnected both cables and dashed
back across the room.  It would become one of the world's most
infamous hacks.  It had taken less than 15 seconds.

_Forget_Bogart's;_let's_hit_Vacarro's_! he emailed Mercuriou, floated
back out to the parking lot, tossed the laptop in the back seat, fired
up a sneak-a-toke, cranked the tunes and floored the rag-top all the
way home.


T - 370 days    drugs must be promoted

Mercuriou: "The routers run the network; hell the routers _are_ the
network.  You control the routers, you control the network.  You're
God.  I'm telling you, this thing's like super-hack."

A silence fell, sharp and sudden, split by a single word from the
kitchen.

Vic: "Burns."

From his perch on the couch, Mercuriou nodded in assent.  In his early
thirties and an inch under six feet, he was indifferently clad.  What
differentiated him more was his refusal to allow a television into the
apartment; an hour each day, timed on a stopwatch, devoted to reading
Latin; a framed letter of rejection from the University of Chicago.
Vic Antonov, waiting for the teakettle to boil, was nearly ten years
older, heavy set with a bristling mustache that often covered a
mischievous smile.

Vic: "So what's the point?  Why?"

Mercuriou: "We're going to Mars."

Vic furled his brows and looked at him like he had just claimed to
have discovered extraterrestrial life.  Mercuriou stared back
impassively, his heart racing.  No, he was serious.  Walking into the
living room, Vic had to return to the kitchen for teabags, as the mugs
contained nothing but hot water.

Mercuriou: "Burns' got a plan, and I think it'll work.  Spaceflight is
perfectly doable; that's been demonstrated over and over for fifty
years.  The problem is money; the problem is always money!  You can't
fly without money, you can't ride without money; no money means no
electricity, no house, no food; they sell bottled water now for a
dollar a pop and half the planet can't drink the crap that comes out
of the tap; next thing'll be bottled air, you won't be able to breath
without money!  Well, now we've got money."

He produced a pack of fifty-dollar bills and fanned them on the table.
Vic stood in the doorway holding something forgotten.

Mercuriou: "Let's just say that there are some Keno systems out there
that are no longer completely random."

Vic: "Marc, this isn't like you, you're not a thief."

Mercuriou: "Well, maybe I've changed."

Vic looked straight into his eyes.  He had changed, as all men do.
Yet now he switched his tone of voice to that of a teenager stammering
to explain a 2 A.M. party to his parents.

Mercuriou: "I'm going to Mars, Vic!  I need the money!"

Vic sighed, handed one of the mugs to his young friend and sat down.

Mercuriou: "They're gonna catch me, Vic.  It's just a matter of time.
I'm into too much cash!  I gotta be gone... like _really_ gone!"

Vic: "Mars, huh... Did you steal the money to go or are you going
because you stole the money?"

Mercuriou didn't answer.  Couldn't answer.

Vic: "Why are you doing this, Marc?  What's it all about... really?"

Finally, they went for a walk, out into the high summer of the New
Mexico mountains, hot and dry, a day that made Mercuriou wish for a
convertible, a surf board, and the PCH before Southern California had
turned into a giant game of Sim City.  They were at the end of a long
driveway that wound between a fifty-foot cliff rising to the left and
a dry riverbed on the right.  He paused and inhaled deeply, saving the
aroma of desert flora.

Vic lead him down a dirt path through the scrub to the door of a
second trailer some distance away.  It looked much like the first one,
except that all of the window curtains were drawn.  Closer inspection
revealed that white drywall backed the curtains, making it impossible
to see in or out.  Vic unlocked a padlock and led the way in.

An overwhelming smell hit Mercuriou -- skunk.  Inside, the trailer had
been stripped of its original furniture and fixtures.  The main room,
some thirty feet long, was lined on both sides with plastic tubs
raised about a foot off the floor.  Inside the tubs were perhaps a
hundred potted cannabis plants, each sporting a bushy top of their
distinctively branching five-part leaves.  Two rows of grow lights
hung down from the ceiling on chain links that could be adjusted in
length as the plants grew upward.  A child's toy pool half full of
liquid fertilizer ran off the same timer as the lights and also caught
the runoff as the liquid percolated back down from the plants.  An air
conditioner hummed in the window, and a dehumidifier discharged into
the pool the water it condensed from the air.  Another hour of small
talk found them back out in front of the cars, intoxicated with a
full-body high that they were just beginning to experience.

Mercuriou: "I'll play their money game... I'll get out there and 'hustle', I'll
'compete', I'll rip and claw my way to the top, and when I get there,
I'll turn around and ram their global capitalist system right back
down their throats."

Vic: "How often do you pray, Marc?"

Mercuriou: "Right now, my only prayer is that Burns can get us into
orbit!"

Vic: "I need some time to think about this."

Mercuriou nodded and left.  Vic stood standing in the shade, watching
the driveway down which the car had disappeared.  The dust settled,
and nothing disturbed the scene except the buzzing of insects.

Vic: "This will require a vision quest."


T - 355 days    religion must look like a waste of time

The entire eastern sky was lit a brilliant red hue, as if a pane of
clear red glass had been slipped in behind the mountains and lit from
below.  Eyes closed, wrapped in a light Indian blanket, Vic awaited
the dawn.  A bright yellow light pierced out from a gap in the
mountains and began to widen into the orb of the sun.  Though
conscious of the light, Vic put off opening his eyes.

One of his favorite prayer spots, the desert canyon looked like a
giant had slashed through the brown hills with a knife and the desert
had bleed a river.  Pristine granite boulders blanketed the slopes
fifty feet on either side of the water.  Cactus and scrub brush
covered the surrounding land.  Amid patches of sandy beach, swirling
pools and murmuring cascades were two-foot diameter logs wedged
between boulders twenty feet above the water line, mute witnesses to
the tropical cyclones that, two or three times a century, settled over
the canyon and filled the arroyo with the raging waters that had
carved it out over the ages.  The water was drinkable, and a gentle
breeze often discouraged insects.  There were flat rocks to lie out on
in the sun, and shady crevices to evade the heat during the peak of
the day, not to mention ample bathing spots in the cool river.

Vic had put this off for weeks, inventing one excuse after another why
he couldn't do it just yet.  He had to let his clients know he'd be
gone for several days.  He had to find someone to take care of the
cat.  There was something on TV he wanted to see.  The moon wasn't the
right phase.  He wanted to finish the book he was reading.  It was
already too late today.  It was still pretty early, he could putter
around for another hour or so before leaving.

The truth was, though Vic had decided to undertake a vision quest, and
knew intellectually that this was the course he wanted to follow,
neither was he looking forward it.  Days of silence and
solitude.  He had done this before, and knew what he was getting into.

He opened his eyes, turned around and looked east.  The sun was the
distance of a man's fist over the horizon.  The doctor rearranged his
blanket so he could contemplate its orb, then spread his arms apart
and closed his eyes again, basking in the gentle warmth of a new born
day. _Another_day_among_days_. _Uncountable_as_our_breaths_of_air_

_Marc_Mercuriou_wants_to_fly_to_Mars_.  Vic turned the thought over in
his mind for the hundredth-odd time.  He drifted back over the years,
the college parties, the mathematical discussions and philosophical
debates, the night Burns drove home on three hits of acid, the
program, the lawsuit, the expulsion.  His head snapped back up.  Had
he been sleeping?  He wasn't sure.  The sun hadn't moved, or had it?
Perhaps it was infinitesimally higher in the sky.

_Marc_Mercuriou's_flying_to_Mars_.  Vic laughed out loud, softly.
What really were the chances?  Yet Burns was involved, so who could
say?  A pair to draw to, those two were.  And they say they've got
some kind of super-hack, no, that he could believe.  If Burns wrote
it, they probably did control half of the Internet.  Burns had always
led the mathematical discussions, and rarely participated in the
philosophical debates.

The sun crept higher and the desert began to heat.  Vic unfurled
himself from his blanket and spread it out as a ground cloth.  He
thought of all the stuff he could be _accomplishing_ right now.  He
needed to transplant those seedlings, and take more cuttings.  The
fence along the riverbed still needed to be repaired after the storm.
He could be making lasagna for lunch, ahhh, lasagna, he could go back
now and at least have it for dinner.  Drive into town for the noodles,
tomatoes from the garden, cheese, he had Ricotta but needed Parmesan.

Vic physically shook himself.  _What_are_your_priorities_? Is it the
perfect baked lasagna or discerning the Great Spirit?
_Some_people_go_through_life_for_the_lasagna_.

Had the sun moved?  He wasn't sure.  _We_waste_so_much_time_, he
almost cried.  Of course, after a while, you know that you'd be
filling the hours with all the _distractions_ - television, food,
drugs, games, books, sex, talking, walking, driving, cleaning.  Out
here, alone, you realize that this is what you waste seven times a
week, and then we die.

Vic stood up and stretched.  The strict Indian vision quest required
not only fasting and sleep deprivation, but was also done naked and
confined to an area no bigger than a patio.  Of course, the strict
Benedictine monk arose at three in the morning to pray, and the strict
Buddhist drank no water after sunset.  Vic fasted and prayed, but was
clothed and allowed himself a somewhat wider leash.  He climbed down
to the water, hopping from boulder to boulder, then striped naked and
bathed.  The stream was still cool, and the morning breeze imparted a
definite chill that turned it downright cold, but in this place, the
rushing arroyo was a luxury that Vic indulged.  He plunged his head
under a ten-foot waterfall and whooped out loud, then stretched out
and floated on his back in the pool at the waterfall's base.  Emerging
from the stream after a time, he laid naked on one of the boulders,
waiting for his skin to dry.

_If_you_go_, _you_might_never_come_back_, his own voice practically
spoke in his head.  _Well_, _no_, he answered,
_one_day_I_won't_come_back_.  One day he might be driving down the
highway, or walking to the store, and in the next moment meet the
Great Spirit.  Maybe he would pick the day and time himself, Lord knew
he had contemplated it enough.  Might he go like some of his patients,
lingering, faltering, fighting death every step of the way?
_Just_not_like_my_father_, please God, _not_like_my_father_, not
witless and lost in his own home, surrounded by the family he couldn't
tell from strangers.

_We're_all_going_to_die_. _It's_how_we_live_that_defines_us_.

The sun was now halfway to its zenith.  Slowly, Vic dressed, then
returned to his blanket.  Perhaps later he would indulge in another
bath.  Hunger was present, but by the third day it manifested itself
more as fantasy than as any physical need.  A pi\~na colada.  That's
what he wanted -- a pi\~na colada, made fresh from coconuts and
pineapples, pureed in a blender with only a flavoring of rum.

_Mars!__He_can't_be_serious_.  Yet he was.  Vic had known Mercuriou
too long to suppose that he was joking, too well to suspect that he
was incompetent, and too dear to consider that he was insane.

Or not.  Their encounter had been shocking.  How much he had changed!
They were like children who had grown up in a nursery, with cartoon
wallpaper and colorful mobiles, and only occasional flickers of a
distant fire glimpsed through the window.
_Men_with_guns_on_a_cruise_ship_.
_An_angry_speech_in_a_foreign_tongue_.
_Soldiers_patrolling_a_street_.  _Protest_marchers_burning_a_flag_.

Then they emerged from the nursery to find the house engulfed in
flames, and no way out.  Many gave themselves to the fire, toyed with
the fire, learned to play with the fire; many assumed that houses were
meant to burn, as they were made of wood.  Some had cowered in the
basement, or taken refuge in the game room.  Some tried to fight the
fire.  Some jumped.

_Where'd_you_hide,_Vic_? _The_smoking_parlor_?
_While_your_best_friends_became_thieves?_

Without moving, Vic looked to where an iguana had just scampered
across one of the boulders and darted into a crevice.  Life!  The
great mystery!  All around him, the plants, the animals, the birds
in the sky, the algae on
the rocks along the riverbed, all alive!  All part of some greater
consciousness!  What would an iguana know of Mars?  Yet both were
here, the iguana and the red planet, somewhere there in the sky.
_We_know_as_much_about_life_as_the_iguana_knows_about_Mars_.

Was it noon yet?  He wasn't sure.  He certainly hadn't brought
a watch.  No, the morning sun still falted the zenith.

_What_else_am_I_going_to_do_?
_Take_my_stolen_millions_and_retire_on_a_beach_?

It was hopeless to talk him out of it.  Maybe before, when Vic
hadn't been there...

_What_else_am_I_going_to_do_?
_Live_in_a_trailer_and_grow_pot_in_the_mountains_?

Vic's own life certainly hadn't turned out the way he'd expected it.

_I_wanted_to_be_a_doctor!_

_Did_the_fish_want_to_live_in_water_?
_Did_the_cow_want_to_be_a_steak_?

Once in his life he
had been in a slaughterhouse.  Hundreds of cattle passing
through a chute to be stunned and butchered, an assembly-line
of death.  _We_don't_always_get_to_be_what_we_want._

What did he want?  Did it come down to that?  Maybe it wasn't about
the Great Spirit after all, maybe it was about Victor Antonov...

_Heresy!__Heresy!__We_don't_choice_for_ourselves;_we_must_DO_THE_WILL_OF_GOD!_

He awoke with a start.  The sun was visibly into the western sky.  How
long had he slept?  At first he felt rage at himself for sleeping,
then disappointment, then resignation.
_I'm_sorry,_father,_ he prayed, _I'm_not_a_kid_anymore._
He lay back down on the blanket and slept.

The sun was deep in the sky when he woke.  He sat and watched it slip down
behind the mountains, until shade came to the arroyo, then watched the
light retreat up the slopes until only the summits were in direct sun.

_If_I_were_up_there_, _I_could_still_see_the_sun._

Finally the sunlight was gone, leaving
only a blue sky that deepened into purple, then black.  Crickets and
frogs trumpeted the arrival of night.  A rattlesnake slithered silently across
the still warm sand.  Here, away from the city lights, stars began to
emerge, first a dozen, then uncountable thousands.

_The_stars!_ Could there be life out there, too?  How could there not
be, in such vast reaches?  Was the Great Spirit only for this world?
Was there a different Great Spirit for every world, every sun?  And
the Greatest Spirit that transcended all?

_Who_knows?__This_is_dogma._

Dogma.  The bastard son of religion raped by logic.  The
pseudo-science of devising laws that govern a game we do not
understand.  For all the paucity of science, at least the physicists
demanded that their equations predict something real.

_Space._ Vic gazed up at the sky.  Blackness filled with light.
Thousands of tiny blazing suns, subtly hued and interspersed with dim
nebulae.  Orion loomed overhead.  Nor was the sky still.  Not only did
the stars shift through the night, but the lights of airplanes high
above passed slowly through the constellations and the occasional
unannounced meteor would flash past in a fraction of a second.  A
satellite transited overhead, still illuminated by the sun.

_So_what_now?_ Vic didn't expect a booming voice from the heavens, or
a dramatic vision, though such things had been known to happen to
others.  At best, these quests ended in a quiet determination, a
clarification of purpose, a sense of a direction forward.  At worst, a
torrent of tears, disillusionment, and doubt that only time, prayer,
and more vision quests could peer through.

_It's_how_we_live_that_defines_us_.  How was he going to live?
Growing pot in the mountains?  Twenty years in the big house with
Mercuriou?  Blown to bits in some goof-ball launch attempt?

_What_if_it_works?_ It was almost impossible.  How could something
this _crazy_ actually _work_?  _Crazy._ Yes, _crazy_.  Maybe he was
ready for something crazy!  He grinned, closed his eyes and tried to
empty his mind, tried to open himself to the Great Spirit.

_I'm_sick_of_being_sane!_ Vic practically lept to his feet at the
thought.  Why be sane?  Why not do something _crazy_?  What's the
worst that could happen - death?  No, jail would be a fate worse than
death.  Death he could handle.  Death meant meeting the Great Spirit.

Vic chuckled, this time aloud.  _Look_at_yourself_. _A_trailer_full_
_of_marijuana_plants_and_you're_worried_about_jail_?  Well, uh, yes,
actually, he was.  _Ahh,_to_hell_with_it._

If he went with Mercuriou, it might be a long, long time before he
returned to this place.  _Or_ever_.  He looked around - the rushing
water in the arroyo could now be heard but no longer seen.  Dim outlines of
rocks and scrub bush surrounded him.  This land was beautiful.  Did he
really want to part with it?  Locked in an air-conditioned tube for who
knows how long? _Some_people_go_through_life_for_the_lasagna._

Orion had crept into the western sky.  To the south, a jet airplane
crossed to the east.  Vic cast his mind to it.  Most of the passengers
would be asleep, or trying to catch what sleep they could in the
jet-lag abbreviated night.  In a dimly lit cockpit, the pilots guided
the plane along a jetway, marked by radio beacons and GPS coordinates,
colorful radar displays and video simulations of the antique
instruments that Earhart and Lindbergh had relied upon.  Would they
peer down into the darkness below?  Would they wonder if anyone was
looking back up?

Once, long ago, a monk had prayed for guidance.  An angel appeared in
a vision to say that God's will was to serve men and in serving them,
to reconcile them to him.  Serve men?  The monk was incredulous.
Three times the angel repeated the command, then disappeared.

Serve men? Serve Marc? Did Marc need him?  _Oh_my_God,_yes_.  He's a thief!
He's lost his entire moral compass!  _If_this_thing_works_...

He was a trial judge.  The murder defendant had been convicted by the
jury, but Vic wasn't convinced.  He wrestled with his conscience.
Dare he overturn the verdict?  Dare he let an innocent man die?  In
the courtroom, spectators laughed, ate, talked on their cell phones.
Angry, Vic called for order, pounded on his gavel.  Didn't they
understand that the issue was life or death?  He struggled to deliver
the verdict, started, stammered, started again, and then the
prosecutor spoke.  There was new evidence.  The defendant was
innocent.  The charges were dropped.

Vic awoke.  Was there light?  Yes, the eastern sky was beginning to
brighten and he could just make out the ridge line of the mountains.
What did the dream mean?  That he was off the hook?  That he had made
the right decision?  Do they mean anything?  He lay on the cool
earth, wrapped in his blanket, watching the stars fade out above.
_Sometimes_the_searching_can_get_in_the_way_of_the_finding._

Another day had past, another had come, and the cycle of life
continued.  He would not fear death; he would not fear jail.  Nor
would he keep living in a house trailer, puttering back and forth to
his hydroponic garden.  He stood up and stretched, then sat still
until it was light enough to see, though not yet dawn.  Slowly he
rolled his blanket, then started down the trail as the sun peaked over
a ridge line.  Halfway to the car, he looked back toward the arroyo,
regretting that he had forgotten to bathe.


T - 239 days    curiosity must kill

In 1998, John Pople became the first man in history to win a Nobel
Prize for writing a computer program.  It was called _Gaussian_, and
it numerically simulated Schr\"odinger's equation, the crucial formula
for explaining the complex interactions that formed atoms and
molecules.  _Gaussian_, and programs like it, made it possible to
analyze atomic structures in much the same way as numerical
simulations of Newton's equations made possible the analysis of
planetary movement in solar systems.  For hundreds of years,
scientists had sought the master formulas of a purely mathematical
Theory Of Everything.  Like two teams drilling a tunnel from opposite
directions, physicists and chemists had pursued a crucial thread of
this common quest, the physicists digging deep into the mysteries of
the atom while the chemists measured and categorized the myriad array
of substances.  Then, in the early decades of the twentieth century,
the physicists broke through the tunnel.  Quantum mechanics, the most
spectacularly successful physics theory of all time, came with one
slight caveat -- nobody knew how to solve its equations.

Alister: "Bed-roooom!"  Alister bobbed his head and sang the refrain
out loud.

The office was actually the living room of a large plantation house
that Mercuriou and Burns had converted into an office for a team of a
half-dozen young programmers.  The parquet floors and picture windows
overlooked a sandstone cliff dropping to an expansive ocean beach
fringed by coral.  Waves crashed against a nearby point, surfboards
were stacked in a rack near the beach trail, and broad overhead
fans circulated the sea breeze.  In a pair of curtain-side semis
hummed a parallel-processing system of more than a thousand
processors.

They were looking for a new type of rocket fuel, liquid at room
temperature and with better performance than the solids.  The bosses
were out of town and the other guys had taken off, so Alister had the
place to himself.  Twenty years old, with matted blond hair, he had
left South Africa to study abroad, finished a double major in
chemistry and physics, then stayed in America after graduating.
TenTech was his first job after college.

Yet Alister fancied himself a hacker, and Burns had carelessly allowed
the young chemist to watch him login to 'genie'.  Alister now used
that password to enter the system and look around.  Its accounting
records showed one program used more than any other, so he ran it.

A new window appeared on his screen.  On it, brightly colored graphics
portrayed a cue stick deflecting billiard balls into a neat square.
Each ball contained a number - sixteen, then thirty-five, then four.
Alister recognized it immediately.  It was a Keno game of the
type you might find in a casino.
_What's_all_this_secrecy_about_a_game_, the young man wondered.  Then
the bottom of the screen caught his eye, where the machine displayed
the current date and time.  _Bloody_hell!?!_


T - 237 days    youth must be corrupted

Mercuriou: "What did he see?"

Mercuriou gazed out the window behind his desk, over the ocean
frothing and seething gray-green under a steady rain, reflecting the
chaotic smear of light patterns that radar engineers dubbed "sea
scatter", then morphing into an indistinct horizon where rain met
cloud met ocean.

Burns: "He ran the program."

Mercuriou: "Did he understand what he saw?"

Burns: "Probably.  He's pretty sharp."

Mercuriou: Mercuriou started to laugh, "so he knows we're thieves!"

Vic: "You think this is funny?"

Mercuriou: "I think it's hilarious!  Our whole operation is made
possible by Burns' super-hack, and now along comes this
twenty-year-old kid who hacks _your_ system!"

Mercuriou: "Now, where are we at?"

Burns: "The older engines work with the new fuel.  We've got a
synthesis pathway, but it can be improved.  We still need an airplane,
spacesuits, launch towers, cargo modules and just about everything
that goes in them, more fuel..."

Mercuriou: "Plus we're short on cash, so we need another big hack."

Burns: "I'm swamped."

Mercuriou: "But we've found a hacker!"

Burns screwed his eyebrows and thought for a moment.

Burns: "He's sharp, real sharp.  One of the best kids I've got, and it
looks like he can hack.  I guess... will he hack... for _us_?"

Mercuriou raised a finger in the air and rose out of his chair, an
adrenaline rush surging within him, like he was asking a stranger out
on a date.

Mercuriou: "Let me take care of that.  Go get Alister."

As soon as Burns was out the door, Mercuriou lept into action, erasing
the whiteboard then rearranging the chairs.  By the time Burns
returned with Alister, Mercuriou was back in his own chair, having
swung it around again, and was leaning back against the desk, watching
the rain pelt against the executive suite's plate glass windows.  Vic
directed Alister to sit in front of the desk, and Burns closed the
door.  The pelting rain and the breaking surf were the only sounds as
Mercuriou watched the streaks of water sliding down the glass and
gazed on toward the reef break beyond.

Mercuriou: "There was an unauthorized connection to 'genie' from your
workstation Saturday night at 9:43 PM.  It was encrypted, of course,
but we know that it lasted about an hour, and... there are accounting
records."

He turned as he spoke and Alister's face flushed red.  There seemed
little point in denying the obvious, but it was curiosity that had
driven him; Alister was neither a natural liar nor thief.

Alister: "I saw Burns type that password."

Burns: "You've seen me type the password?"

Alister: "I read it over your shoulder."

Mercuriou almost snickered again, then covered his mouth with his hand,
recovered, and pressed on.

Mercuriou: "...and what did you see?"

Alister: After an awkward silence, Alister answered. "It's tomorrow's
lottery numbers today."

Mercuriou now got up out of his chair and walked around it.  A deep
calm overcame him.  He visualized himself as an ace closer walking to
the mound in the bottom of the ninth, digging in on the rubber,
looking in for the sign...  He stopped directly behind his chair
and locked eyes with Alister.

Mercuriou: "OK, you figured that out, but it's a lot bigger than that.
This is a _heist_."

Alister: "You're robbing a bank?"

Mercuriou: "We've already cleaned out one, and we're thinking about
taking down another.  We've got to get away, though; we've stolen too
much already.  That's why we need a new rocket fuel."

Alister: "So, you're going... into space?"

Mercuriou: "Mars."

Alister: "Yeah, and I'm Nelson Mandela."

Mercuriou: "This is no joke."

Alister: "What I saw on that computer screen was nooo space shuttle."

Mercuriou: "There will be!  Not exactly like NASA's; we've got a
different design.  But I'm no petty thief!  We've stolen because we
_need_ the money, need it to do something that'll make a difference
for the whole world!"

% "We've got push space technology forward!"

Mercuriou: "Is the future here on Earth, Alister?  What do our leaders
want?  To drive technology forward?  Really?  Promote innovation?
Promote freedom? Is that why they've outlawed on-line libraries?  Is
that why they want a wall across our southern border?  Liberty?  Is
that what they call the drug war?"

Mercuriou began to pace again in front of the window, now glancing
regularly at Alister.

Mercuriou: "They want to sell you gasoline, or video games, or stadium
tickets at prices people will grumble about and then pay while they
eat out every night and take their vacations on Maui.  We could have
video-on-demand, right now, I'm telling you!  We could take every
T.V. show aired in the last week and have it right there at the push
of a button!  We could take every book in the Library of Congress and
put it online for anyone in the world; we've _got_ that technology!
People in Cambodia could be building their own computers, but we keep
the designs secret while they sew our T-shirts.  The only innovation
our leaders want is innovation that they can control!"

Mercuriou: "So we need a revolution, and it's not going to happen in
this world; the establishment is too strong.  But out there..."

Mercuriou: "Think about it, Alister!  Grow your own food!  Make your
own power!  The asteroids are practically pre-mined!  If we find a
pure vein of gold, everyone will be copying this design to build their
own spaceships and race after us."

% "If not, we can still mine the minerals we need to build more ships.
% Silicon chip production should actually be easier in a vacuum!"

Mercuriou: "Six billion people on this people!  Think about it!
_Six_billion_ of us!  How many of them make a difference, really?  How
many of them get out of their easy chairs and change the world?  If
the human race is going into space, we've got jump start it and show
the world that ordinary people can do it, not just seven colonels and
majors at a time in a space shuttle!  And _to_hell_ with what our
great leaders here on Earth think about it!"

Mercuriou walked to the window, folded his hands behind his back, and
gazed out over the ocean.

Mercuriou: "...but it all sounds so crazy... too wild to be true!"

He turned and looked Alister straight in the eye.  The young man was
plastered back in his chair, his eyes riveted on Mercuriou.

Mercuriou: "I think you're intrigued, Alister!  So check out our
launch complex, and _then_ tell me what you think!"


T - 112 days    Christians must seem crazed

Kyle: "So what'd you think?"

Kyle's Volkswagen zoomed down Interstate 45 toward the Johnson Spaceflight
Center.  The morning rush hour had passed, and an electronic sign over
the roadway advised, `NASA Road 1 -- 5 minutes'.

Andrea: "When I heard the learn'd astronomer..."

Kyle: "Oh, come on, Andrea!  They're publishing the whole synthesis
pathway!  ...and disclaiming all the patent rights!  I thought you'd
love it!"

She thought over yesterday's press conference.  Some new rocket fuel,
no _revolutionary_ new rocket fuel, truly revolutionary.  What were
they calling the company?  TenTech?

Andrea: "Kyle, I just get sick of all these guys who act real cool,
and wear blue jeans to work, and call everybody 'dude', and deep down
inside they're a bunch of bastards.  I'll bet you they've got some
kind of angle on this, just wait.  The engineer really knew his stuff,
but the CEO was a con artist."

Kyle: "Well, 1033's no con, Andrea!  TenTech's ramping up to full
production!  Terry and Steve are working on a new design; they're
talking about a shuttle without SRBs!  Maybe single stage to lunar
orbit!  I thought you'd be excited about this, I mean, this could
really mean people living in space!"

Andrea: "Kyle, we've got airplanes flying between all of our major
cities every day, and for most of the six billion people on this
planet, they might as well _be_ space shuttles.  Our problems are here
on Earth."

Kyle: "Well, I thought you'd be excited about this."

Andrea: "I didn't mean it like that.  I mean, if you want to do it...
I just know that _my_ problems are here on Earth.  I'm not blasting
off from the Cape again."

Kyle: "OK, well... OK."

Andrea: "Thanks for inviting me down, though; it's been too long since
we've seen each other!"

Kyle: "Next time take a plane, I'll pay for it; you give me such a
fright hitchhiking!"

Andrea: "You put your faith in God, Kyle...  and you tie your hair up
under a cap and lose the miniskirt!"

% Kyle: "A space suit, yes; a mini-skirt, never!"

Kyle pulled off I-45 and stopped at a city bus stop.  Andrea got out
and pulled her bag out of the trunk.

Kyle: "Sweetheart, you sure you don't want a plane?"  She shook her
head as he pulled out five twenty-dollar bills and handed them to her
along with a bus token.  "Just this once take the Greyhound!"

Andrea: "Thanks, Kyle.  I love you."

Kyle: She hugged him, and he got back in the car before quietly
answering, "I love you too, girl," and then cried out "Call me when
you get home!" as he drove away.

It was ten o'clock in the morning.  Andrea climbed on a half empty
downtown local and gazed out the window as the controlled access
highway gave way to mid-market chain restaurants, landscaped malls,
downtown streets and finally the transfer station.
_What's_wrong_with_me_, she wondered.  Wasn't Kyle right?  Wasn't it
good of these men to disclaim the patent rights on their invention
instead of trying to monopolize it?  _Give_to_all_who_beg_of_you._
Wasn't it the Christian thing to do?  _Maybe_I'm_just_being_cynical_.

At the transfer station, instead of walking the three blocks to
Greyhound, she spent five minutes deciphering a wall of posted bus
schedules, then climbed onto another local headed into one of the
older sections of town, walking the last quarter mile to a
hundred-year-old Catholic church that occupied an entire city block.
Built of iron, stone, and glass, it could have been mistaken for a
prison except for the cross mounted on its steeple.  Walking around
back, she found a rear entrance sporting a colorful sign that read,
`The Franciscan Fryer'.

Entering, she found herself in a tiled dining room set with
white plastic tables and metal chairs.  Three men were preparing for
lunch.  Hanging against the far wall was a rood icon cross, painted in
Byzantine style, with a red background and a bevy of saints behind the
figure of the crucified Messiah.  Andrea recognized it immediately ---
the San Damiano Cross, replica of the crucifix which, eight hundred
years earlier, had spoken in a vision to the young man who knelt
before it in prayer near the Italian village of Assisi.

Bible: "Now go hence, Francis, and build up my house, for it is nearly
falling down!"

Francis had looked about him at the crumbling chapel he knelt in and
set out to do as the vision commanded.  Returning to his father's
shop, he took several rolls of fine cloth (without permission), rode
to a nearby market town, sold both cloth and horse, and returned to
the chapel, where he tried to press the money into the hands of a
very reluctant priest.  Andrea had always felt that it was a typical
message from God: simple, powerful, and very easy to misunderstand.

"We don't serve until eleven."

Andrea: "I'm looking for Brother Dunstan."

"Oh, he's probably in the kitchen."

She walked to the rear of the room, separated from the kitchen by a
long counter.  A pot-bellied man in his late forties, with
balding hair and a worn apron covering the brown habit of the
Franciscan order, muttered to himself as he stirred a steaming kettle
on the commercial stove that dominated the rear of the kitchen.

"Andrea!"

Andrea: "Hello, Dunstan!"

"Oh, Andrea!  What a joy it is to see you!"

Andrea: "Thanks, hey this place looks great!"

"Well, you know, I had somewhat different expectations for it.  I'd
wanted something more like a restaurant, you know, that would also
serve as a soup kitchen if people couldn't pay, but Andrea, we just
couldn't pay the rent downtown!"

Andrea: "That was the place on Travis Street?"

"Right!  I mean, a lot of people did pay, but usually only just enough
for their own food, you know, and then with those who didn't pay or
couldn't pay, well, we just couldn't afford to stay there.  It was a
nice location, but we just had to leave.  I prayed a lot, well I
worried a lot, and then this place turned up!  The rector here said we
could use the church's kitchen for free, and Andrea, it's been a real
blessing, because I try to keep the place open seven days a week, you
know, and on Sundays now so many people stay after church for lunch
that it's really helped the congregation, you know, their social life,
and I get regular donations now from them, and well, I just don't know
what I would have done without it!"

Andrea sat down as the workers finished setting up the room, and
Dunstan put the finishing touches on lunch, which they shared just as
the first customers, mostly homeless, came in.  The food, especially
considering its meager pretensions, was excellent.  There was fresh
baked bread, coffee and orange Tang ("the drink of astronauts!",
Dunstan toasted), a thick lentil soup with just enough tomatoes and
onions to give it depth, and tuna salad, replete with chopped Granny
Smith apples and stuffed into the fresh bread, one of Dunstan's
signature dishes.

"Can you stay until Sunday, I'm making stuffed peppers, you know, I
always like to do a nice lunch for the congregation?"

Andrea: "No, thanks, I'm heading back to my mom's place in Iowa today.
I just came down to visit Kyle Lankier, he has a new project, some
people have developed a new rocket fuel."

"You know, I heard about that!  They say it's quite revolutionary, is
that true?"

Andrea:  "Yes, it seems to be.  Kyle's quite excited about it."

"Well maybe we'll have one of our oblates flying back into space,
ehh?"

Andrea shook her head vigorously.

Andrea:  "No way, not a chance; I've made my last shuttle landing."

As she was leaving, she quietly took one of the envelopes from a
holder on the table.  It was blank, except for a quote from the
Gospel of Matthew: 

Bible: {{ "When I was hungry, you fed me."

She fished the bus transfer slip out of her pocket and inspected it
closely.  It was still valid.  She put the rest of her money into the
envelope, sealed it, and slipped it into the drop box on her way out
the door.  Using the transfer to take a city bus to the northern
extremities of Houston, she walked another quarter mile to the
Interstate, sat down her duffel bag beside the ramp, and began
thumbing for a ride.

More than a hundred cars passed in about an hour before a cab stopped.
Andrea had almost not bothered to raise her thumb when she had seen
the distinctive yellow car. _Judge_not_by_appearances..._

"I'm only going about twenty miles to pick up a fare."

Those miles conveniently ended at an exit with a truck stop. She
didn't want to go into the restaurant, because she didn't want to
harass the truckers for a ride while they were eating, nor did she
want trouble with the management.  Instead, she fashioned a cardboard
sign reading "Iowa" and sat down with it between the parking area and
the on-ramp, making sure she could be seen from both.  Trucking
companies didn't like truckers giving out rides, but one of drivers
gave her a lift anyway.  He was going right through her state.

They talked through the afternoon as the miles drifted away.  He was
an aspiring writer who wanted to hear everything she could tell him
about NASA.  He was also a convicted hacker and was wearing a
monitoring bracelet on his ankle.  As dinner time approached, Andrea
explained a bit more about her religious order.

Andrea: "I appreciate the ride, and don't expect you to feed me just
because I gave all my money away.  I can fast until I get home.
Seriously."

"But you get everything by begging, right?"

Darren bought dinner at a diner in Oklahoma, during which Andrea
showed him a small plywood replica she kept of the San Damiano cross
and told him the story of St. Francis.

"So why did he give everything away?"

Andrea: "He was inspired by a Gospel quotation during mass: Do not
possess gold, nor silver, nor money in your purses.  This was two
years after the vision."

"How on earth did he live?"

Andrea: "Well, when he was rebuilding the church, he actually sang in
the marketplace and then asked his audience to donate stones.  The old
priest there would feed him dinner every night, but Francis didn't
want to impose on him, so he started taking a bowl and begging
door-to-door at dinner time.  By the time he ended his circuit through
Assisi, his bowl would be full, and that would be his dinner."

"So you go around town with a bowl!?"

Andrea: "No, I'm not as good a Franciscan as Francis was.  Nobody is.
What's happened to me is that I've found good friends and family to be
my surest supporters.  I don't travel as much as I should.  Maybe I'm
becoming a Benedictine."

...and then they talked on about how the Benedictine order favored
stability over the nomadic life, establishing monestaries and working
to maintain them rather than begging.  Later, Darren began squawking
into his C.B. radio as they approached the Iowa line.

"Got a rider here looking for a ride to Iowa Springs...  Any drivers
out there heading towards Iowa Springs?..."

After nearly an hour of intermittent radio calls, driving closer to
Iowa all the time, he finally raised a truck delivering a load to a
silo only twenty miles from Andrea's family farm.  Andrea helped that
trucker navigate the back roads, called her mom for a ride from the
silo, and was home in bed by three o'clock in the morning.



T - 93 days    it must be sly

Mercuriou: "Any suggestions?"

Burns: "_Technical_Sketch_Four_?"

Mercuriou put his hands on his hips and stared at Burns.

Burns: "Well, that's how I think of it..."

They stood at the base of a 767, its engines replaced with rockets,
its doors welded shut, a hydraulic mating adapter on its nose.  It sat
in a hanger adjacent to their private runway, on a cliff overlooking
the ocean.

Alister: "_The_Royal_Way_?"

Vic: "But this isn't the Royal Way, Marc, it's all stolen!"

Mercuriou's stare was cold, but there seemed a strange smile behind it.

Burns: "_Manifesto_of_the_Secessionist_Party_?"

Mercuriou rolled his eyes.

Vic: "How about
_On_The_Evil_of_Capitalism_and_The_Danger_of_Democracy_?"

Mercuriou: Mercuriou now shook. "You want me to put
_that_... _there_!" and waved toward the ship's cockpit.  Vic studied
the spot thoughtfully.

Vic: "Perhaps something shorter would be better."

Burns: "_The_Great_Hawaiian_..."

Alister: "_Icarus'_Wing_!"

Mercuriou: "What?"

Alister: "You heard me."

Mercuriou stared at the Afrikaner in disbelief.

Mercuriou: "You know who Icarus was?"

Alister: "Yeah."

Mercuriou: "Like hell we're naming it _Icarus'_Wing_!  We're naming it
_Xplorer_One_!"


T - 7 days    friendship must be paid for

"I'm inclined to say the thing looks like a front operation, but that
doesn't make any sense, either."

Sitting in the shade of her mother's porch, with a pitcher of iced
limeade on the table and two glasses half consumed, Andrea read
in silence.

"You were right about Mercuriou, too.  I don't believe a word that
comes out of the man's mouth.  I just can't figure out his angle."

Andrea: "There's no question that this stuff works."

"None!  That's what doesn't make sense!  They're always having
production problems; they need more time."

Andrea: "No way.  Not with the quantities of nitric acid they're
consuming.  They've already been shipped enough to fuel about three
conventional shuttle launches."

"Why are they doing all this in Hawaii... why?"

Andrea: Andrea pushed the papers away.  "Sounds like you need a
detective, Kyle."

"I need somebody who can't get blown off by a bunch of techno-babble!"

Andrea: Andrea laughed anxiously.  "What are you getting me roped into?"

He looked deflated.  Andrea sighed.
_Give_to_all_those_who_beg_of_you_...  especially your best friend!

Andrea: "All right," she visibly collapsed. "I'll go."

"Great!  Listen, I've got everything set up; I'll pay for the plane
ticket and advance you a thousand dollars.  Their main facility is at
a place called South Point..."


T - 2 days    heros must act like bums

Twenty thousand feet over the Pacific Ocean, the inter-island jet
darted across 'Alenuih\=ah\=a Channel, swept down Hawaii's leeward
coast, grazed Keahole Point at two thousand feet and touched down at
Kona International Airport amid a broken jumble of blackened lava
flows.  Unlike Honolulu's congested and dilapidated air hub, Kona was
more a collection of stone huts than anything bearing the grandiose
title ``International Airport''.  As the ground crew pushed a ramp up
to the plane (there was no jetway), the passenger in window seat 8A
stared morosely at an ATM card.

Kyle: _What_am_I_supposed_to_do_with_this_thing?_
"Just stick it in the machine and don't worry
about it." _...in_no_manner_are_they_to_receive_coins_or_money_..._

She broke it in half and threw it in the trash almost as soon as she
got off the plane.  _It_has_to_be_done_The_Royal_Way_.

Andrea: "Excuse me, can you tell me how to get to South Point?"

"You can catch the Hele-On there in front of the space center."

The space center?  Indeed.  After the Challenger disaster, Hawaii had
built the Astronaut Ellison S. Onizuka Space Center to commemorate the
life and loss of one of her most prominent citizens.  The small white
building was closed when Andrea walked up to it, so she merely peered
through its windows and set down her backpack to wait for the bus.
Experience told her that bus drivers would sometimes give free rides
to the destitute, and that other passengers might assist when drivers
were unwilling.

No such finagling was necessary.  The Hele-On was a free service
operated by Hawaii county, so Andrea took a seat, cracked open a
window, and enjoyed the ride as the bus meandered past shopping
malls, more broken lava, seaside villages, beach parks, a high
school campus, an elevated tennis court and over every rise and around
every corner, the ocean, the ocean, the ocean.  The empty bus soon
filled with an assortment of locals heading home, and the driver even
waited for one passenger to mount a bicycle on a rack before boarding.
An intermittent drizzle began to fall as Kona's rich volcanic soil
gave way to the rolling forested hills on Mauna Loa's southern flank.

Dusk was falling two hours later when Andrea disembarked at the road
leading to South Point.  Few riders were left on the departing bus;
most had gotten off at a park-and-ride a few miles back.  There was
little to remark upon except a road sign and an abandoned building,
which Andrea immediately seized upon as a Godsend.  A quick
investigation of its contents revealed a detachable bench seat that
would serve as a small but usable bed, and several scraps of carpet
that could be passably used as blankets.  Weeds were growing up
through the floorboards, while liquor bottles and graffiti bore mute
witness to the transients that, like her, occasionally livened the
old building for a few hours.

Yet was this The Royal Way?  It hardly seemed fit for a queen, but
then neither had Christ's crown, nor had his throne.  Andrea took one
of the carpets, walked back across the road, wrapped it around her,
and sat down to see if anyone would take pity.  Several cars passed,
but none stopped.  After half an hour, the rain began to fall again,
so Andrea returned to the old building and settled in for the night.

Perhaps here, in this world, this _was_ The Royal Way.


T - 1 day    danger must first appear innocent

It had rained off and on throughout the night, but the old building's
roof was solid and the carpets had cut enough of the chill to allow at
least a few hours of sleep.  Now, shortly after dawn, Andrea packed
her bag, straightened up the ramshackle furniture, and walked out to
the road, where a young couple was waiting for the bus.

"Do you know what time it is?"

She fished her cellphone out of her pack long enough to check.

"Seven-thirty."

They reacted with disappointment.  It was a free service, but ran only
once or twice a day, and they were waiting for a 7 AM bus.  Andrea
wished them luck and set off on what she thought was the last leg of
her journey.

Edged by low stone walls on either side, the lonely asphalt road
meandered south though a forest interspersed with orchards and citrus
farms.  She sipped some water from a rusty basin on the side of the
road.  After an hour of walking, fatigue and doubt began to conspire
against her.

_This_is_stupid;_

_I_look_like_a_bum_not_an_engineer._

_I_can't_function_in_this_society._

_How_long_is_this_road?_

_He_might_have_to_come_out_to_Hawaii_to_get_me,_maybe_he_can_hold_my_
_hand_through_this_...

_You_need_him_to_hold_your_hand?_

Andrea: As the tears rolled down her face, she turned her face skyward
and implored God, "Why am I here?  This is stupid!  This is all
because I decided to do some stupid favor for money." No answer came
back from the heavens, only the mid-morning sun blazing down from the
sky.  The silence encouraged her to speak loudly and openly to the
deity, something she rarely did in the crowded city.  She fell on her
knees in the middle of the road.

"I'm sorry; I'm sorry!  I thought this was the right thing to do!
Now, please God, how do I get out of this without loosing Kyle's
money?"

Physically and emotionally exhausted, she sat down right there, cried
steadily for several minutes, then took stock of her situation.  Her
jeans were ripped from where they had snagged on a nail, her right
side was covered in dirt from the carpets, her hair was matted with
dried sweat, and she had slept in her clothes.

_This_is_stupid_.  _I_am_NOT_OK_.  _I'm_filthy_and_exhausted_,
_and_I_can't_show_up_looking_like_this_.

_No_dumb_fuel_problem_is_worth_this_...

_That's_what_I'll_tell_Kyle_...

_No_dumb_fuel_problem_is_worth_this_...

_That's_what_I'll_tell_Kyle_...

She was awake before the car stopped.

Two men were seated in the car, both dressed for the endless Hawaiian
summer in shorts, T-shirts, and sunglasses.  The man in the passenger
seat was talking on a cellphone and completely ignored her.  The
driver, a friendly fellow in his early twenties, asked her in a funny
Australian accent if she needed help, and she mumbled something about
heading back into town.  She climbed into the back seat, and he
started driving again.  The passenger, having problems hearing his
phone conversation, waved them both silent.

Mercuriou: "No, no, no, we've got plenty of 1033.  We've got tanks and
tanks full of it.  You can come see that for yourself.  We just have
to get the export paperwork taken care of.  It's just a delay."

Mercuriou: "Of course it works!  You have the samples, don't you?"

Mercuriou: "Well, then make it yourself!  We can pay for the
spacesuits in cash."

Mercuriou: "I will need time to find another buyer."

Mercuriou: "I know I just said that, and you said we could pay in fuel..."

Mercuriou: "Just let me handle it.  I'll make it work.  I promise."

%\selectlanguage{russian}
Mercuriou: "Cpacebo.  Cpacebo.  Do cbidaniy."
%\selectlanguage{english}

The passenger clicked the cellphone off, then punched some more
buttons on it.  While Andrea slowly digested what she had heard, he
made another call.

Mercuriou: "Yeah, what's up?"

Mercuriou: "Well, if he doesn't show, he doesn't show."

Mercuriou: "A woman?"

Without disconnecting or even lowering the cell phone, he slowly
turned around in his seat, looking at her almost as if seeing her now
for the first time.

Mercuriou: "I'm sorry, ummm, we weren't really introduced..."

Andrea: "Andrea Yeats," she replied in a matter-of-fact tone, then
nonchalantly added, "I'm with NASA."

At various times, Andrea had seen people red-faced with excitement,
hysteria, and embarrassment, but now, for the first time in her life,
she actually watched someone's face as it turned red.  The flush began
just above Mercuriou's cheekbones, then, in a split second, spread to
his cheeks, his forehead, and then ran across his entire face.  He
clenched his teeth and turned back around in his chair.

Mercuriou: "I'll get back to you," he told Vic in a clipped voice,
severed the connection without waiting for an answer, took the
earpiece out of his ear, wound its cord around the telephone and put
in down on the dashboard.  For a moment they drove on in silence.

Mercuriou: "Turn around," Mercuriou quietly told Alister.

Andrea: "Look, I'm heading into town, I can just walk back..."

Mercuriou: "You're not going anywhere," Mercuriou interrupted as he
unclipped his seatbelt, turned fully around in his chair, and revealed
the handgun he had covertly retrieved from its holster under his seat.

Alister brought the car to a stop, then looked back and forth between
his two passengers with a pained expression on his face.  Meanwhile,
Andrea slowly realized that she was being kidnapped.

Mercuriou: "Turn around," Mercuriou repeated, "Go back."

Within sight of the highway, Alister executed a three-point turn and
headed back down the road.  Again past the stone walls, the orchards
and farms, past her break-down spot, they drove on as the forest gave
way to broad meadows framed on three sides by hundred foot cliffs and
the Pacific Ocean beyond.  They passed through an automatic gate,
crossed a runway that stretched fully from one side of the point to
the other, and drove past a hanger into a complex of low buildings.

They walked into a large room whose walls were lined with whiteboards
hung over cluttered office tables amid a jumble of cardboard boxes and
packing material.  Andrea walked willingly, partly out of curiosity,
partly because there was simply no other place else to go.  She never
thought of running.  Burns was there, sporting a black T-shirt that
read simply "CAPITALISM SUCKS", as was Vic, who looked up from a
notepad as they came in.

Vic: "The man who called was named Kyle Lankier..."

His voice drifted off and an awkward pause ensued.  Mercuriou turned
around.

Mercuriou: "Doctor Yeats," he began slowly, pausing and measuring his
words, "during the ride here... I was trying to decide,
umm... exactly..."

Andrea: "What you're going to do with me?" she speculatively completed
his sentence.

Mercuriou: "Precisely."

Vic: "What's going on?  What happened?" Vic asked, the second question
addressed to Alister as if expecting an explanation from him.

The young man opened his mouth as if to speak, but couldn't quite
explain how he had picked up a woman seated crying in the middle of
the road, or how Mercuriou had continued his imprudent cellphone
conversation, or how they had discovered the true identity of their
passenger.  Finally, after a second or two, he just shrugged his
shoulders and closed his mouth without saying a word.

Andrea: "I believe the colloquial expression is that I 'know too
much'."

Mercuriou: "Um-hum," Mercuriou responded, nodding in agreement before
turning towards Burns.

Mercuriou: "The old server room, can you rig the door so it can't be
opened from the inside without a card key?"

The engineer leaned back in his chair and nodded slowly.

Vic: "What are you thinking, Marc?" Vic asked with concern in his
voice.  The only reply was a raised palm.

Burns: "Yeah," Burns began slowly, "the locking mechanism is in the
wall, so I could weld the door handle in place, along with the bolt.
You couldn't open it at all from the inside..."

Mercuriou: "Fine. Do it."

Vic: "Now, wait a minute, Marc, you're talking about kidnapping now."

Mercuriou: "Vic, we will have this discussion later."

Vic: "No, we won't have it later..."

Andrea: "He's not talking about kidnapping, he's done it... Vic."

Mercuriou: "Vic!  We will have this discussion later!  We will have
this discussion _when_Dr._Yeats_is_not_in_this_room_.  OK?  Now,
_please_, let's just get all the loose stuff out of that room while I
stay here with the doctor."

The other three men looked slowly at one another.  None of them liked
what they were being asked, no, told to do, but Burns got up and lead
Alister down a hallway, leaving Andrea, Marc and Vic to eye each other
in silence, she sitting on a chair in the middle of the room, the
captain perched on a tabletop with his pistol still in his hand, and
Vic still seated in his chair.  Twenty minutes later, the concierge
returned to announce that the room was ready.  Mercuriou escorted the
NASA engineer down a hallway and around a corner to a windowless
forty-by-one-hundred-foot room populated solely by a rectangular grid
of floor-to-ceiling black steel frames.  Upon entering, Andrea turned
back to face Mercuriou.

Andrea: "Don't I get some fancy explanation of what you're up to?"

Mercuriou: "No," he answered, then closed the door behind him, insured
that it was locked, and began to walk away.

Andrea: "Mr. Mercuriou," she called through the wall, "I'm sure we can
discuss..."

The card key flashed through the lock with such a swoosh that Andrea
took an involuntary step back from the door, then another as it was
pushed open.

Mercuriou: "Captain Mercuriou, it's _Captain_ Mercuriou!"

...and he was gone.


Launch Day    it must be funny

Vic: "No, Marc, no, absolutely NO!"

Mercuriou: "Three days, Vic, that's all we need -- three days!  Burns
wants a week, but I'm compromising on three days!"

Vic: "You're not compromising on a damn thing, Marc!  You're talking
about holding someone prisoner -- an innocent person -- for days!
You've already held her captive for a night!"

Mercuriou: "It has to done, Vic!  It just has to be done, and we're
not arguing about it!  Alister!"

Vic: "Yes, we are arguing about it, Marc!"

Mercuriou: "Alister!  Get an MRE and a bottle of water and give it to
Dr. Yates!  Dammit, Vic, don't fight me on this!"

Vic: "Marc, you can't do this, you just can't!"

Andrea had woken early in the darkened room.  She had no watch, and
there were no windows, but it had _felt_ like morning.  At least she
seemed rested.  She sat up against the wall and began to pray,
starting with the Lord's Prayer.  Softly, just barely audibly, she
repeated it three times, each more slowly than the last, contemplating
the words more deeply each time.

_Thy_will_be_done._ _Am_I_here_for_a_reason,_Lord?_  _For_your_reason?_

_...as_we_forgive_those_who_trespass_against_us..._
_...if_someone_forces_you_into_service_to_walk_a_mile_, _walk_two_...
_I_forgive_these_people_here_, Lord, _they're_almost_comical_

As she did so often, she returned to Christ's prayer in the garden,
"not my will, Father, but thine."  _Not_my_will,_Lord_,
_if_you_have_some_reason_for_me_to_be_here_, _and_you_must_,
_thy_will_be_done_, Lord, _thy_will_, _not_mine_, _thine_.

She sat still, practicing a Buddhist exercise that she had learned at
a class and adopted for Christian use.  She focused on her breath, in
and out through her nostrils.  She tried to clear her mind of her own
thought and cast it upward, trying to enter a calm state where she
could, just maybe, like Elijah in the cave, hear the still, quiet
voice of God.  When she got caught up in her own imagination, she
re-focused on her breath and tried to calm her mind again.

She didn't do a very good job.  In fact, she never did a very good job.
Meditation was the hardest thing she had ever attempted, far
more difficult than executing some suited procedure that she
had practiced a hundred times in a water tank on the ground.
Her mind kept racing back to her present situation, all the
craziness of the last two days, _why_didn't_she_run_?,
_what_do_they_want_with_spacesuits_?, _breath_in_,
_breath_out_, _breath_in_, _breath_out_.

At least she resolved upon a plan, if you could call it that.  She
waited quietly until the electronic lock clicked and the door was
cautiously pushed open.  It was the blond-haired youth with the
foreign accent.

Alister: "Sorry... I brought you some breakfast!" he announced as
cheerily as he could muster, putting a bottle of water and a military
ration down on the floor next to the door.

Andrea: "Do you think I could use the bathroom?" Andrea asked,
standing up and pushing her hair back.  He seemed indecisive, and
didn't answer at first.

Andrea: "Look, I'm covered in dirt; I haven't bathed in two days;
I've slept in my clothes for two nights; I'd like to at least splash
some water on my face and go to the toilet."

There was no need to lie.  It was all true.

Alister: "OK... uh, sure, it's right down the hall," he answered,
before leading the way about a hundred feet to a restroom.

Alister: "I'll wait here," he mumbled.

She turned on the water faucet and immediately started searching for
a way out.  The room had no windows but was covered with a ceiling of
drop panels.  Climbing onto the back of a toilet, she could reach the
ceiling and push one of the ceiling panels aside.  She started to
scramble up, but saw that the wall continued straight up to another
ceiling several feet above the panels.

"Shoots!" she muttered to herself, then climbed down and went to the
other side of the room.  The sinks might not be strong enough to support
her weight.  Returning to the toilet, she realized that she could just
reach a large, circular pipe above the panel ceiling.  Climbing up
again and grabbing it, she pulled herself up to it and found herself
crouched in a dark, dusty space between the two ceilings.  In the dim
light, she could make out the course of the wall down to where it met
the hallway.  In the other direction, the crawl space seemed to extend
beyond the bathroom, so she clambered along the pipe in that
direction.  Once past the bathroom, she opened one of the ceiling
panels below, swung her legs down into it, and dropped down into the
sunlit room below, slipping, grabbing the ceiling, and bringing part
of it crashing down with her.

There were chairs, a desk, books, a drafting table covered with
papers.  She picked up the telephone handset on the desk, then stopped
to look at the books on celestrial mechanics, materials science and
rocket propulsion.  She put down the phone and walked over to the
drafting table.  _Spain_never_designed_a_rocket_engine_.
_They_aren't_selling_fuel_; _they're_hoarding_it_.
_They_need_spacesuits_,_too._

Mercuriou: "Vic, we are not arguing about this!  This is a command decision!"

Vic: "I will not accept this.  I will not accept this."

Mercuriou: "I am in command of this mission!  I am giving an order!"

Vic: "Give your order, Marc, I'll go to police right now!  I'll pick
up that phone myself!  I mean it!"

Mercuriou: "Vic, if you pick up that phone,
I'll... I'll... I'll... What!!!?"

Alister: "It's Dr. Yates, she's still in the bathroom..."

Mercuriou marched down the hallway and announced his presence.

Mercuriou: "Coming in, professor, pull up your pants!"

Broken from her reverie, Andrea snatched up the phone once more and
dialed, listening to the noises in the next room as it rang in Houston.

Andrea: "Kyle, it's Andrea!"

Kyle: "My God, girl, where are you?"

Andrea: "I'm at TenTech; they've kidnapped me and are holding me
prisoner here!"

Kyle: "What?!"

Andrea: "Look, they've got a launch on!"

Kyle: "What kind of launch?"

Andrea: "Manned.  They have spacesuits... and forget three shuttle launches;
they've got enough fuel here for three hundred!"

The door's electronic lock clicked and Andrea dropped the phone, threw
the chair through the window as Mercuriou dashed in and jumped out.
_They've_got_guns!_ _They've_got_guns_! Running up the road, she began
to calm down as she reached the runway.  _So_what_if_they_do?_ She
slowed down and finally stopped completely as she reached the
automatic gate.  _Where_are_they?_

They were glued to a webcam of the highway junction, which showed
police squad cars peeling off to the south in response to a
kidnapping report.

Mercuriou: "OK, our launch clock's at four minutes...  Let's get to the ship!"

All four of them dashed out of the room and piled in the Jeep.
Alister gunned it up the road to the hanger, where they found Yeats
inspecting the exterior of _Xplorer_One_.

Andrea: "This is quite a rocketship you've got here."

Mercuriou motioned his crew towards the access platform.

Andrea: "You have some kind of launch planned?"

Mercuriou: "Why don't you just get lost?  Haven't you caused enough
trouble today?"

Mercuriou followed his crew up the metal staircase while Andrea
followed him.  _A_private_manned_launch_.  For the first time since
Kyle had talked her into this, she actually wanted to laugh.
_THIS_I_have_GOT_to_see_.

Mercuriou: Mercuriou had reached the hatch, climbed inside, and turned
around, ready to close it.  "Well, Doctor, you can go now.  Sorry for
your detention, but it was necessary at the time..."  he began, but
never finished, because Andrea grabbed the rim of the hatch, swung her
feet up, and kicked him squarely in the chest.

Andrea: "Captain Mercuriou!  _Captain_ Mercuriou!"  she hollered,
clambering in behind.

Vic: "What's going on?" Vic called from the cabin.

Andrea: "It's Captain Mercuriou!  He fell!"

Mercuriou flew to his feet, so enraged that he half-hallucinated four
men with red shirts and black pants, already moving to seize the
intruder and awaiting only his order to throw her out.  He blinked and
they were gone.

Andrea: "Do you want the hatch closed now?  Is that your next order... _sir_?"

Mercuriou gritted his teeth and snarled through them.

Mercuriou: "You don't what you getting into, lady."

Andrea: "Then clue me in."

Mercuriou: They locked eyes for a moment, then Mercuriou pressed his
face within six inches of hers and hissed "Mars!"

She broke into a wide grin.

Andrea: "That's great; I've always wanted to go to Mars!  Now, you
might need an experienced astronaut; I've had three weeks on orbit.
You've got suits; I hope you've got motion sickness drugs..."

He tried to interrupt, but she shushed him.

Andrea: "...but first, you've got to _get_ into orbit, and that I've
_got_ to see!"

Alister: "Here come the coppers!"

Mercuriou: "Burns, start the engines!" Mercuriou yelled, then turned
back to Andrea.  "OK, this is it, this is it, I'm not kidnapping you
-- Vic you are my witness! -- I'm not forcing you, but you get out
now, I'm telling you we're not coming back for a long long time, I say
get out right now, or you're in this for good, and I mean for good!"

The two rocket engines roared to life and the ship began to tremble.
Andrea felt like she had when she picked up Dunstan in the rain, when
she wrote 'math class' on the auction form, when she decided to quit
NASA.  She nodded her head.

Mercuriou: "Fine."

_Xplorer_One_ sped down the runway as police cars swarmed the complex.
Some of the policemen watched with their months agape, deafened by the
roaring engines and stunned by the sight of a jumbo jet belching
rocket exhaust as it lurched off the cliff, dipped perilously close to
the ocean a hundred feet below, then gained speed and climbed to ten
thousand feet.

Burns: "Launch cargo!"

Alister keyed a command sequence on his computer.  From camouflaged
launchers in the forest below, first one rocket thundered aloft, then
another, and another.

Alister: "Three all-green; four launching!" Alister called out from
his computer monitor, while Vic and Mercuriou were arguing again.

Mercuriou: "She doesn't really need a spacesuit," Mercuriou tried.

Vic: "She most certainly does need a spacesuit, Marc.  We have spares
in cargo, but what happens if we lose cabin pressure before then?"

Mercuriou was silent for a moment.  Only Alister's voice was heard.

Alister: "Seventeen's up; sixteen just went inertial; eighteen launching!"

A panic seized the nearby towns as missile after missile streaked
skyward; many thought the nation had gone to war with Libya.

Vic: "We have to abort the mission."

Mercuriou: "We are not aborting this mission!"

Andrea: "I'm fine; I'll take the chance."

Vic: "No, you are not fine!  I'm the ship's doctor, and telling you,
Marc, we have to abort this mission because _she_could_get_killed_ if
we lose cabin pressure."

Alister: "Nine just acquired LEO; thirty-four launching."

Mercuriou: "Then let her take mine."

Vic: "No, she can't take yours, because then _you_ won't have a spacesuit."

Mercuriou: "OK, so then I'll die and you'll be rid of me and you can
do whatever you want!  Look, Vic, we can't go back!  If we go back, we
go to jail!  I'll take my chances with death!"

Vic relented.  Death over jail, that he understood.  Andrea got the
spacesuit.

Mercuriou: "How do we look, Burns?"

Burns: "We've got clean launches on the first fifty-one
rockets... make that fifty-two; everything's fine."

As soon as Andrea was suited and seated, Burns put the plane into a
near vertical climb.  It wasn't the most optimal launch profile, but
the aircraft wasn't designed for supersonic flight, so Burns made sure
that he climbed above the atmosphere before beginning a true orbital
insertion.  As they passed fifty miles in altitude, he nudged forward
on the joystick, the engines pivoted, and the giant blue ball of the
Pacific Ocean swung up below them.  They were now above most of the
atmosphere, and Burns began their insertion burn proper, firing the
engines continuously for nearly ten minutes, then cutting them off and
letting the ship coast.  Finally, he fired the engines again for
several minutes to stabilize their orbit.

On Earth, confusion reigned.  CNN reported the last several launches
live, and speculation was rampant that the missiles contained some
kind of chemical or biological agent.  Around the world, TV networks
began interrupting their regular programming to cover the event,
showing graphical ground tracks of the orbiting cargo modules and
warning people as they drifted above.  The U.S. State Department was
fielding a barrage of queries from foreign embassies anxious to know
what was happening.  The President abandoned a trip to Europe and
turned Air Force One back towards the capital.  Once there, he held a
hurried meeting of his national security team, finally blowing up in
frustration at their inability to provide any concrete answers,
throwing a briefing folder and sending Top Secret papers flying.

"Why the hell do I have find out from CNN when 170 missiles get fired
off in Naale-Naale-...whatever-the-hell!"

That evening, the President addressed a rapt but unshaken nation,
refining the news that the networks had been reporting for hours.  A
renegade group of entrepreneurs, under investigation for wire fraud
and kidnapping, had somehow managed to execute the first private
manned space launch.  After reassuring the public that the government
was carefully tracking the situation, the President correctly
identified the four principle suspects, then took three questions.
When asked if he was pursuing a diplomatic solution to the crisis, the
President replied only that attempts were being made to contact the
perpetrators.  When asked if a military response was being considered,
the President replied that the military always stood ready to defend
the nation, but it was not yet clear if an attack was imminent.  When
asked if the U.S. military was capable of striking a target in orbit,
the President had no comment on U.S. military capabilities.

In Houston, Kyle Lankier watched the press conference alone and in
silence.

Andrea Yeats was never mentioned.


T + 1 day    long political rants must be interspersed throughout

Andrea: "Excuse me?  What are you doing?"

Mercuriou had hollered since launch to get lined up with the cargo
modules.  They assembled them together by matching orbits, docking
their nose, then re-positioning them into a higher orbit, connecting
them together as they went.  They collected first Module A-1 Captain's
Quarters and then attached Module A-1-1 Captain's Storage.  Mercuriou
then halted the entire operation to dock with A-1 Captain's Quarters,
equalize pressure, and disappear.

Mercuriou: "I'm working on my speech for this evening, Dr. Yates.  It
must be delivered live in American prime time.  I wish I had longer to
prepare, but your stunt disrupted my timing.  Now please leave me
alone."

Andrea mumbled a reply into the closing hatch.

Andrea: "You know, there's really a lot of work to be done with the cargo
modules..."

The hatch flew back open.

Mercuriou: "Dr. Yeats, my speeches are the most important cargo this
vessel carries!"

News of the rocket launch had galvanized the world, or at least
everyone in the world, or at least everyone in the Most Important
Country In The World.  Now came live pictures of a man floating in
zero-gee, in a manner quite unprecedented.

Red banners festooned A-1's rear wall, and hid the access hatch to
A-1-1 behind them.  Two vertical Roman lances impaled with globes of
Mars rose on either side of a desk, behind which Mercuriou now
appeared seated with a tablet computer in front on him, dressed in a
crisp white uniform as might be worn by a cruise ship captain.  The
rest of the crew watched from behind the camera.

Mercuriou: "Good evening.  My name is Marcelius Mercuriou, and I am
the captain of the spaceship _Xplorer_One_.  Most people call me Marc.
Some people call me Sir."

Mercuriou: "I and my compatriots have today launched a bold new
venture.  We intend nothing less than to begin the colonization of our
Solar System!  We do this not so much because we wish to, but because
we must!  We can not wait around and let our planet be destroyed while
some cynical bunch of global manipulators push everyone to 'compete'!
We much protect our freedom; we must safeguard our independence!  Like
the pioneers who set out across America's wilderness 300 years ago, we
know that the path forward into uncharted lands is fraught with danger
and discomfort, yet it is the only way forward."

Mercuriou: "We do this because America is committed to enslaving the
world, and her only condition is that the chain be fashioned out of
gold.  Your choices under capitalism are to become a capitalist, to
work for them, or to be thrown homeless on the streets.  Becoming a
capitalist means becoming a cynical, indifferent bastard who stands
behind a counter, shrugs his shoulder if you don't have money, and
tells you to Get The Hell Out if you don't like it."

Mercuriou: "Such people are, of course, hated.  Many of us bitterly
resent their rule; why else would phrases like Love It Or Leave It and
Get The Hell Out have become part of our national lexicon?"

Mercuriou: "So I have decided to Get The Hell Out!  Why not?  We know
what kind of leadership America has.  It's not going to change.  Why
would it?  It's what The People want.  It's just not what _I_ want."

Mercuriou: "I am declaring tonight the Republic of Mars.  Let me
inculcate some of our principles, starting with freedom of speech.
Unlike capitalists, who, like communists, see information as something
to be locked down and controlled, we are determined to construct
on-line public libraries, available free of charge to everyone on this
planet.  We have already begun such a library, and I will now begin
transmitting its books to anyone with a satellite dish.  We do this
both as a moral duty to provide mankind with this knowledge, and also
as a legal right, because as a sovereign nation the Republic of Mars
can operate these transmitters, much like the United States operates
the Voice of America."

Mercuriou: "See, we believe that political freedom is meaningless
without economic freedom.  It isn't enough to let the Maldives have an
election.  They need to build their own computers, their own cars,
their own houses.  To do this they need information, information about
how factories work, blueprints, source code, chip masks, all kinds of
things.  They need an information society.  We're committing to making
that information free, rather than locking it down to maintain our own
economic control."

Mercuriou: "Free technology isn't just about free software, it's about
the environment; it's about going green.  What happens when one of
your capitalist gizmos breaks?  You toss it into the nearest landfill.
Now if the design is open, that device can be repaired.  The
capitalists don't want this.  They don't want technology that can be
repaired.  They want throw-away technology.  Instead of repairing
these devices, they want you to buy a new one.  Going green isn't
mandated carbon scrubbers on smoke stacks.  It's building clean, open,
sustainable technology that everyone can build, improve on, and
repair, and the first step is make sure everyone knows how it is
designed and built."

Mercuriou: "We're committed to freedom of travel as a fundamental
human right.  True freedom comes not from an election, but from
variety among nations, coupled with the freedom to travel.  I call on
the United States to open her borders, to become once again the nation
that beckoned 'give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses
yearning to be free'.  Our own borders are completely open; anyone can
come to Mars, and anyone can leave."

Mercuriou: "We will, of course, abolish this outrageous drug war on
Mars.  It is a gauntlet thrown at the foot of liberty, the
government's claim that it can tell the individual what he can put in
his own body.  All of these people's governments are the same.  They
always end up at war with their own people, and most of them call it
war, too.  The Drug War is America's Cultural Revolution, our
Committee of Public Safety.  We've got a problem, The People are going
to fix it, and the government is going to make the people do it."

Mercuriou: "We're going to build a society where people respect each
other, respect each other's talents and well as each other's
differences of opinion.  We're going to preach tolerance, not Zero
Tolerance.  We're going to build a society where people like each
other, and help each other out."

Mercuriou: "Some of you are wondering how we funded our launch.  Well,
how could we have funded it?  Venture capital?  Only if I'd lied
through my teeth about my true intentions, right?  The government?
They only put Air Force colonels into space, right?  So we developed,
let's say, an alternative source of financing.  We robbed a few
banks."

Mercuriou: "You sell your soul to these capitalists, I mean you really
convince them that you're one of them, that you believe in their
nightmare philosophy of greed, you bring them on your management team,
you sign off on some 'business plan' that tells how you're going to
patent and control this technology once it's developed, because they
won't do anything for anyone unless they're getting money for
themselves, and then you fight like hell just to keep 51 percent.  Or
you toil away in your garage for ten years of nights and weekends
while working some stupid job just to pay for the stupid garage, and
I'm not much of stupid garage guy."

Mercuriou: "See, Spaceflight _can_ be done, but we live in a society
hell-bent on forcing people to work for a System, and telling them
constantly that they have freedom.  You don't beleive me?  Ask
yourself if you'd rather be flying into space right now or doing
whatever mindless job you've got?  Our great capitalist leaders could
be mass producing spacecraft by the thousands.  Ask yourselves, 'if
they needed them for a war...'?"

Mercuriou: "Let's apply their own rationale.  I'm 'helping them
compete'.  If a few banks go out of business, so what?  Throw it into
a chapter!  It's nothing personal; businesses fail every day.  I'm
developing technology to fly to Mars, so the whole society benefits."

Mercuriou: "Oh, and one other thing... I'm not part of the
majority... I'm a druggie!  I'm a socialist!  I'm an anarchist!  I'm
farther left than Jane Fonda!  I'm more anti-American than Eagle Six!
I'm against everything 'The People' believe in, and they're against
everything I'm for!  I'm not part of the majority, and I don't like
democracy."

Mercuriou: "'The People'.  They make it sound like it's what _all_ the
people want.  Then why do people blow up federal buildings; why do
they bomb our embassies, why do they burn the country's flag?  Why do
they need the largest prison system in the world?"

Mercuriou: "Obviously, there's a lot of people who don't agree with
America, and I'm one of them.  The majority makes up these rules, and
then expects everyone else to obey them just because they're made
'through a democratic process'.  People obey the rules because they're
afraid of what will happen to them if don't.  The only thing that's
different about democracy is that it's a different group of people
making the rules.  In Russia it was the proletariat; in Germany it was
the Aryan race; here it's the majority.  It's always the same.  Some
big bunch of people that think that because they're more advanced, or
because they're the workers, or because there's more of them than
anybody else, that they become 'The People' and they have the right to
rule over everybody else."

Mercuriou: "I feel as bad about ripping off capitalists as I would
about ripping off communists or fascists, because to me they're the
same.  Just another bunch of men with some nightmare system to be
jammed down everyone's throats."

Mercuriou: "But there are alternatives!  Not many left on Earth, mind
you.  Earth is civilized, which means it's been conquered, colonized,
and commercialized.  No matter where you go, there's some established
government, be it democracy or dictatorship, and you're just a little
cog that better turn when its supposed to and not need too much oil.
Out here, though, an entire solar system is waiting to be tamed!"

Mercuriou: "The first thing we're going to do is land on Mars, and
plant our flag there, because that is where our capital will be!  Then
we'll explore the asteroid belts.  If we find almost anything
valuable, gold or silver, platinum or pure silicon, it'll be 1849 all
over again!  And when you think that there's a whole planet out there,
all broken up into pieces already..."

Mercuriou: "Then we'll have something Earth wants!  Then we'll trade
with them on equal terms!  Then we'll have freedom!  Think about
joining us!  Maybe not literally, at least not yet, but perhaps
spiritually?  We have a website, when it is not blocked by the
government.  We have satellite equipment, when it is not jammed.  What
skills can you offer?  Let us know!  Write a biography of yourself!
Upload it to our website!  Join our movement and help build a new
tomorrow!  Onward Martians!  Onward to Mars!"

Alister: "Whoo-hoo!"

Alister barreled down the module at the speed of a racehorse, his
arms flailing wildly.  He pulled them in to his sides and made his
body rigid as he sailed through a mating node into the next module.
Now he waved his arms in front of his face.

Alister: "Ahhhhh!"

Again he pulled his arms in to his sides, passed another mating node
and began gyrating wildly.

Alister: "waHHHH!"

He tucked, grabbed a handlebar as he flew into the 767, and spun
around into a pull up that he released with just enough backward
momentum to let him glide into the cabin.  Droplets of sweat from his
forehead kept going, spraying out over where the rest of the crew were
talking.

Mercuriou: "I'll plant their flag!  I'll plant it face down in the
Martian dirt!"




Andrea: "Look, there are certainly plenty of people who would love to
quit their jobs, throw off their leaders and fly away into space, but
how are they supposed to get up here?  The simple fact is that you had
to steal billions of dollars just to launch five people into orbit, and
that's fairly consistent with NASA's cost budget.  What you're
suggesting is completely impractical."

Mercuriou: "OK, I'll concede that they're not going to make it up here
exactly the way we did, but what's the alternative?  There's nothing
left on Earth.  It's a failed planet turning into one big global
hegemony."

Andrea: "You can't rationalize a decision just by saying that the
alternatives are unacceptable."

Mercuriou: "Why not?"

Andrea: "Because the solution to missing the school bus is not to
invent a time machine!  Sometimes _all_ of your options are
unacceptable.  Then it becomes very easy to pick the most attractive
one and gloss over its manifest defects.  That's why we have planning
meetings and project cost estimates, Gantt charts and Capability
Maturity Models.  If _none_ of your options are capable of hitting
your target, then you need to know that _before_ you push the little
red button in the launch tower!"

Mercuriou paused and studied her.

Mercuriou: "Andrea, I have studied these options.  The one I've chosen
certainly has a lot of defects, but I really am convinced that it
might work.  Mars, I admit, is a bit of a publicity stunt, but after
we've landed there we've got to take a close look at the asteroid
belt.  There are probably more minable mineral resources there than on
the entire Earth.  If we can set up a manufacturing plant there, with
the robotic automation technology we've got, then we can build more
ships like this one.  We've already built one, so we know how to do
it.  We can set up hydroponics to grow food, establish a colony there
and send ships back to Earth to bring more people."

Vic: "We're not going to need the hydroponics, Marc."

All eyes turned to the hatch.  Though the crew, gathered together in
the 767, had not specifically excluded Vic, they had grown used to his
absence.  His first appearance outside his quarters in a week now
stunned everyone.  While Mercuriou silently assimilated his statement,
Andrea was the first to respond.

Andrea: "So how was the meditation, Vic?"

Vic: "Andrea, the meditation was... great.  I've always struggled to
achieve really deep meditation; my mind's always going a million
different places at once.  It's the hardest thing I've ever done, but
up here... floating... weightless... up here it was _easy_!  But I
suppose you already knew that!"

Andrea: "Actually, I've never been much into meditation."

Vic: "Oh, come on.  Prayer, meditation, listening to God... call it
what you will.  Don't tell me you've never sat for an hour in silence
in some quiet chapel somewhere."

Slowly, Andrea nodded.

Vic: "Have you never tried it up here?"

Andrea: "I can... well, no, truthfully one of the most profound
spiritual experiences of my life came during a spacewalk.  But usually
my time on orbit is so stressed out and hectic, not to mention cramped
and noisy, that, no, I don't really see space as a time for prayer and
contemplation.  Maybe I should."

Mercuriou: "What did you mean... that we don't need the hydroponics?"

Vic: "I'm not sure, Marc.  It's just real clear to me now that you're
not going to need a doctor, and you're not going to need the
hydroponics."

Mercuriou: "So...what?  We're just going to give up after a year and
go home?"

Vic: "Maybe.  I don't know."

Mercuriou: "What then?  You're saying we're going to die up here?"

Vic: "No, I didn't say that, either.  I can't really explain it, Marc,
except to tell you that I wrestled mightily trying to decide whether
to come along on this.  I know now that it was totally worth
it; I'm thrilled to be here; I don't question it now for a minute, but
I also know that... I've gotten _centered_, Marc, I don't know how
else to explain it, I've gotten centered, and I understand now that my
presence here is totally superfluous.  You don't need me... as a
friend, yes, as a spiritual adviser, too, but not for anything else."

Mercuriou: "And what happens... when our food runs out?"

Vic: "I don't know."

Mercuriou: "You've just got... one of your 'feelings'?"

Vic: "More like a certainty."

There was another long pause.

Alister: "Can I say something?"

Mercuriou: "Sure, say whatever you want."

Alister: "Well, if we move out of orbit, I mean, that's what we're
taking about, right?  That puts us out of range of the space
shuttle!?"

Andrea: "That's a real good point, Alister.  Look, you've made your
point.  Now we've got to test this craft.  Let's start looking at
re-entry scenarios..."

Mercuriou: "We're going to Mars, Dr. Yeats, that's not going to
change."

Andrea: "Fine, you can go to Mars, but first you've got to test this
spacecraft in a controlled environment where there are rescue options
both in orbit and on the ground."

Again there was silence, a longer one.

Burns: "She's got a good point, Marc."

Mercuriou guffawed.

Mercuriou: "First Vic, now you going turn traitor on me too, Burns?"

Burns answered with a laugh of his own.

Burns: "Hey, I'm just saying that what she says makes a lot of sense!"

Mercuriou: "Burns, the minute, nay, the second these wheels touch the
ground, we're just five little nobodies at the mercy of those
governments."

Andrea: "We could contact a neutral country...  Switzerland might let
us land."

Mercuriou: "Sorry, Doc, it's not worth the risk.  Burns, what do have
to do to leave orbit?"

Burns: "Well, we've got assemble the rest of the cargo modules..."

After assembling the rest of the cargo modules into a long chain, they
mated the 767 to the rear and drove the entire assembly into
interplanetary orbit.  Meanwhile, almost imperceptibly, they changed
from Breaking News into Established Fact, and promptly vanished from
the media news coverage.


T + 72 days    nobody plays by the rules

Andrea: "I think Jesus already gave us those rules far better than I could."

Vic: "The problem is that people don't play by those rules.  Just
because the teachings are transmitted, doesn't mean they're
understood.  Just because they're understood, doesn't mean they're
practiced.  They're talked about all the time, but mostly it's just
talk."

Mercuriou: "I don't know about that, Vic.  Edward Gibbon thought that
Christianity was a major factor in the downfall of the Roman Empire.
At first the Romans were Pagans, they gloried in the martial arts,
taught their children the virtues of war, worshiped gods like Mars and
Jupiter.  Then came along the Christians, everybody started turning
the other cheek and forgiving their enemies, before long, no more
Roman Empire."

Alister: "But people have to work to live, right?  I mean, people have
always had to eat!"

Vic: "It's true that people have always had to work to eat, but this
notion that people have to work _for_the_society_ is what we're
talking about.  Take the Native Americans, for example.  If anything,
they believed that society had a responsibility to the individual to
raise him to be independent.  They taught their kids how to build
fires by rubbing sticks together, not how to buy a lighter at a
store."

Alister: "So we should give up our technology and go back to living
like Indians?"

Vic: "It might not be a bad idea."

Mercuriou: "So the philosophers have turned to politics to try and
find their freedom there.  Their latest dopey idea is democracy; they
keep trying to convince us that freedom is to be found in that dumb
vote, and don't you dare try to tell these people otherwise.  They'll
scream you down as a Communist until the work bell rings.  Go to
church on Sunday to hear how you need to work hard so you can give
more when they pass the collection plate around."

Andrea: "Marc, do you still need me to distinguish true Christianity
from bastardized Christianity?  Jesus didn't teach us to work to eat,
in fact, just the opposite.  He taught us not to worry about food, or
clothing, or housing.  He said to put your faith in God for those
things.  He pointed out that the birds in the air don't sow the field,
or reap the harvest, yet God provides them with all the seed they need
to survive.  Jesus taught us to put God first, love and generosity
second, and let your faith take care of the rest."

Mercuriou: "That sounds good, Andrea, but faith in God didn't get any
of us here.  None of the companies that sold us this equipment did it
for love or generosity.  They did it because they thought they would
get something out of it for themselves.  We got here because we were
willing to take it."

Andrea: "That's funny, Marc, because I don't remember taking anything
from anyone.  Faith in God got _me_ here."


T + 107 days    there must be a sex scene

The club was packed.  Colored beams of light flirted with the
twenty-something revelers on the dance floor as strobes pumped with
the beat and lasers scanned above the fog that filled the room.  By
the bar and in the alcoves, older men flirted with the youth.  The
crowd, high on liquor and pot, sweat and sex, moved and vibed with the
latest rock/rap hit.

Alister weaved and bobbed with a twenty-year-old brunette wearing a

twirled and then pressed her head against his chest.  Breathing deep,
he inhaled her fragrance and squeezed her tight.

\vskip 12pt

Alister: "Let's take a shower!" he yelled over the music.  She shot

shower with you, I think it'd just be fun!"

Mercuriou: "What the hell are you doing!?" Mercuriou shouted, "You're
supposed to be looking for Andrea Yeats!"

Alister: "Wha... what?" Alister blubbered as he jolted awake.

He was alone in his darkened compartment, wearing a pair of headphones
connected to the laptop floating nearby.  Yanking them off, his heart
pounding, he listened intently for the captain's voice, but heard
nothing other than the constant hum of the air conditioner and the
tinny noise squeaking out from the headphones.  He unplugged them from
the laptop.  Silence.

Calming, he stretched and exhaled.  Grabbing hold of a pillow floating
nearby and squeezing it in a tight embrace, he dozed back to sleep.
_Man,_she_was_HOT._


T + 124 days    madness must prevail

Mercuriou: "We _have_ to land."

Andrea: "Why?  Why do you have to land?  Why
can't you just go back to Earth?  You've already accomplished more
than any other space mission to date.  _Xplorer_One_ will go down along
with with Vostok 1 and Apollo 7.  So what that we didn't land..."

Mercuriou: "We have to land!  People don't
remember Apollo 7; they remember Apollo 11!  If we don't land, they'll
say we failed.  Then they'll come back a few years from now and make
the first landing on Mars; hell, they'll use our technology to do it,
and everyone will remember Captain so-and-so or Major such-and-such
saluting the first American flag on Mars!"

He now swung his face close to Andrea's and lowered his voice.

Mercuriou: "But they'll be too late!  _I_'m planting the first
American flag on Mars --- face-down in the Martian dirt!"

More than a hundred million people were watching the crew conference
on television.  Now settled into Mars orbit, and with a landing
attempt only days away, most terrestrial cable TV systems devoted
a channel full-time to the _Xplorer_One_ video feed, which now featured
the main cabin of the 767.  During the crew's sleep cycle, a scrolling
orbital panorama of the red planet's surface had become a standard
fixture on many a TV screen, highlighted by a small colored box
labeled "LIVE -- Mars Orbit".

Andrea: "So let them!  Why do you have to risk everything just to win
your private little war?  Or do you seriously think you can survive
down there?"

Mercuriou: "Well, maybe you find this hard to understand from your
cushy NASA perch, but there's a lot of people back home rooting for us
to show the world that you don't have to become one of these ruthless
bums to get something done in life."

Andrea: "Oh, please!  Don't you?  Haven't you?  How many billions did
_you_ steal, Marc?  How many toes did you step on?  Don't tell me you
haven't become ruthless!"

They locked eyes.  Mercuriou fell into his slow-and-firm,
no-nonsense tone of "command".

Mercuriou: "We are landing on Mars.  That has been a
primary mission objective since day one.  We take the risks as they
come.  If you learn to live with disappointment, she'll never leave
you for another man."


T + 150 days    somebody has to die

"We're getting a lot of vibration," Burns reported from the left hand
seat in 767's cockpit, descending backwards through the Martian
atmosphere with the plane's nose aimed at the sky and Vic seated next
to him.  Light engine thrust was being used as a brake.  Andrea
had finally got her demand met for a test flight.

Some people were watching.  A continuous video feed was available on
most America cable TV systems, showing either the interior of the 767
where the crew mostly lived and worked, or a slowly scrolling video
panorama of the red planet below, "LIVE - Mars Orbit" stamped on the
upper left-hand corner of the screen no matter what.

"Is that unexpected?" Vic asked.

"It didn't happen on Earth; I'm slowing down more."

Burns pushed the throttles forward.  They were still more than ten
kilometers high, and he was clearly expecting the vibration to ease as
the rockets slowed the vehicle.

"Burns, you, uh, you've got a lot of atmospheric turbulence developing
around you," Mercuriou reported from orbit, crammed into A-1 Captain's
Quarters along with Andrea and Alister.

"What's going on here?" Burns wondered aloud.  "This should be
dampening!"

Instead, it was getting worse.  The ship was definitely beginning to
vibrate.  The vibration somehow spread outward from the ship and
coupled into the atmosphere, which responded by swirling around and
buffeting the ship with wind.

"I'm aborting," Burns declared as he pushed the throttles forward,
and the entire ship began to shake like a washing machine.

The 767 was now in the center of a full-fledged Martian cyclone.  The
engines strained at full throttle.  The ship slowed, stopped, and then
began to climb.  In the cockpit, the two men heard a terrible ripping
sound as the rudder tore away from the fuselage and went careening
away towards the red planet below.

Vic: "What was that?"

A wailing alarm, first three red lights and then dozens of red and
amber lights on the instrument panel answered his question.  The
spaceplane lost its equilibrium, pitched back and began to yaw,
overwhelmed by the aerodynamic forces of the maelstrom, a raging
hurricane with no eye.  The left wing snapped off the fuselage, and
slammed into the battered tail.

In the cockpit, Vic watched the mad swirl of the artificial horizon
like a exposed tank commander staring at an armor piercing round
headed straight for his turret.  He glanced over at Burns, fighting
madly against the controls, and a calm peace enveloped his soul.

_Now_I_get_the_answer_key._

Mercuriou: "Is that a clich\'e?"

Vic: "What?"

Mercuriou: "nevermind"

Vic: "I saw an angel, mommy!"

Mercuriou: "Burns?  Burns?"


T + 156 days    suicide must be contemplated

The Captain stopped working.  He moved into A-1-1 Captain's Storage
and let Alister and Andrea do all of the work, or more precisely all
of the work in A-1 Captain's Quarters, because Kyle's Mission Control
facility in Houston was now constantly on one of the monitors.
Sometimes Andrea would just stop and watch it for several minutes,
unable to directly participate because of the nearly hour-long
round-trip radio time lag.  They arranged an elaborate system of
communications, transmitting each other a summary of their progress
every hour, then pausing an hour later to listen to the other's
summary, which had been transmitted half an hour earlier, and then
transmitting another.  They also arranged for an audible alarm to
sound if they wanted to interrupt the other's proceedings.

"Oh, and thought you might want to see this," Kyle announced towards
the end of his 0800 transmission, the first of the morning.

He held a popular American newsstand tabloid to the camera.  A
photograph of their spaceship was overlaid with a drawing of a
wild-eyed seer with deep, penetrating eyes staring directly out at the
reader.

"Apparently some of Nostradamus's quatrains referred to the _Xplorer_One_
--- something about 'the great bird crippled in the night' --- looks
like the death of your chief engineer is only the first of many woes
to befall you guys, let's see, the first death was by fire, the last
will be by ice, and, oh yeah --- none of you will ever make it back to
Earth alive!  Houston out!"

Andrea: "Thanks a lot, Kyle," Andrea told the video screen as the
transmission ended and was replaced by the usual screen cluster on the
projector.  "When I get home, remind me to read you _your_ obituary
over coffee in the morning!"

After finishing her coffee, she knocked on Mercuriou's hatch, entered
without waiting, and closed it behind her.  He turned away from the
tiny portal window and faced his first officer as she cued a video on
his tablet computer's monitor.

Andrea: "This is what Alister recorded on the high-speed film."

The video showed the doomed 767 in high definition, seen from almost
directly above, buffeted in slow motion by hurricane force winds.

Andrea: "NASA's been able to enhance it to show the eddies."

The video now showed strong vortices coming off the running engines,
enlarging and growing, twisting and coalescing into a single massive
storm.  Andrea let it play through the breakup sequence.

Andrea: "We've estimated the decent path of the cockpit, but there's
no reason to think that anybody's still alive or that we
have any kind of viable ground rescue option."

The video played on, now showing only the storm slowly dissipating and
disappearing like a phantom conjured by a voodoo priestest.

Andrea: "We just don't know what happened.  It looks like the engines
created some kind of storm, but nothing in any of our Martian
atmospheric models predicts anything like it."

Mercuriou said nothing.

Andrea: "We've got OMS-27 coming up.  It's a 37 mega-newton burn
starting at 13:42 tomorrow.  It has a tapered entry and step cut-off,
is 3 hours, 17 minutes and 13 seconds in duration, and puts us on
course for Earth."

Mercuriou: "A three hour OMS burn?"

Secretly, Andrea was glad to see this reaction, much more so than
quiet resignation, but this she tried not to show.

Andrea: "We don't have the 767 anymore, Marc.  We've taken a spare
engine out of storage just to get any propulsion at all.  It's going
to take three hours just to get out of Martian orbit.  And our
transfer orbit will be a year and half long."

Mercuriou: Mercuriou nodded assent, then announced "I'm going to
sickbay.  I've got a headache."

Sickbay had not been opened since Vic's death.  The captain keyed the
lock, found that it didn't work until Andrea keyed it, then opened the
hatch and pulled himself through.  Andrea followed, then they stopped
and looked around.  Nobody had been here since Vic's death.

The room was immaculate.  Everything had been either cleanly stowed.
Vic's laptop, normally floating free at the end of its tether, was
neatly packaged away.

Mercuriou: "Why doesn't my code open the door anymore?"

Andrea: "You're on suicide watch."

Mercuriou: "That's what you think I'm thinking?"

Andrea: "I don't know, what are you thinking?"

Mercuriou: "You don't want to know what I'm thinking."

Andrea: "Yes, I do.  I really want to know what you're thinking."

Mercuriou retrieved some pills, Andrea checked them and nodded her
ascent, then he dry swallowed two of the capsules and shoved a third
back into the container before stowing it.

Andrea: "So what are you thinking?"

He floated still and was silent for a while.  Encompassing the entire
ship with a wave of his arm, he answered.

Mercuriou: "I knew this thing was dangerous.  I guess I always figured
if somebody was going to die, it was going to be me, so... so what,
right?  I didn't think it would be my best friends."

Andrea: "We all knew it was dangerous."

Mercuriou: "Oh no, you're right!  We all knew it was dangerous!  It's
just... I... I never thought I'd survive!  If we died, we died!  We
all agreed on it!  We made a pact!  I never thought that they'd die,
and I'd survive!  Oh my God, this is horrible!  I don't know what to
do!  I don't... Oh my God!"

Andrea lowered her voice, moved closer, and took him by the arm.

Andrea: "Look, they died because you cut corners; because you weren't
perfect!  Your ship wasn't perfect, and as you now realize, your plan
wasn't perfect either.  Now the whole thing's a disaster.  But _I_
knew your plan wasn't perfect, and I came anyway.  It's over.  It may
take you a long time to forgive yourself; actually, you'll _never_
forgive yourself, but it's over.  You made a mistake that you'll have
to live with the rest of your life; guess what, it happens.  It's time
to go on.  It's also a bit easier because we've only got one place to
go, and that's home."


T + 499 days    communism must be preached

Bible: Andrea had by now received a special dispensation to celebrate
Mass without a priest, and her televised Sunday services, often
highlighted by direct dialog with her congregation of two, had earned
her an unlikely reputation as a space-bourne televangelist.  Today's
Gospel lesson featured Matthew 7:21: "Not every one that said to me,
Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that does
the will of my Father which is in heaven."

Andrea: "This is one of my favorite parts of the Gospel,
because it affects one of the deepest rifts in Christianity -
the split between Catholics and Protestants.  Five hundred years ago,
the Catholic church had gotten into the practice of selling
indulgences; essentially telling people that through charitable
donations to the church they could buy their way into heaven.  We have
since repudiated that practice.  Before that occurred, however, Martin
Luther spoke out decisively against indulgences, among other things,
and when he would not retract his statements was expelled from the
Catholic church.  He initiated the Protestant Reformation, founded the
Lutheran Church, and adopted the doctrine of Justification by Faith,
which teaches that salvation is achieved solely through accepting
Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior.  In one form or
another, this doctrine is accepted by most Protestant churches."

Andrea: "Matthew 7:21, however, shows that Justification by Faith, at least in
its most extreme form, is itself seriously flawed.  Merely mouthing
the name 'Jesus', no matter how piously done, is not a substitute for
actually doing what God wants.  Christ told us the same thing, a
little bit differently, in a parable.  Let's look at Matthew 21:28:"

Bible: "What do you think? A man had two sons; and he went to the first and
said, 'Son, go and work in the vineyard today.'  And he answered, 'I
will not'; but afterward he repented and went.  And he went to the
second and said the same; and he answered, 'I go, sir,' but did not
go.  Which of the two did the will of his father?"

Alister: "Actions speak louder than words."

Andrea: "Precisely.  So when Christ says that not all who call him
'Lord, Lord' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do
the will of his Father in heaven, not only is it an amazing
suggestion, that God actually has a will for each and every one of us,
all six billion of us, but it provides a simple statement of what our
goal should be in life -- to do the will of God."

Andrea: "This, of course, is much easier said than done, to the point
where _discernment_ has become a buzzword in religious communities.
Some advocate meditation; St. Ignatius developed a lesson plan; Vic's
technique was the vision quest.  Rick Warren developed a more
autonomous approach in _The_Purpose_Driven_Life_.  He encourages his
readers to look at their own skills, their own interests, their own
limitations -- in short, their own gifts, and achieve discernment by
asking how best to invest them, as in the parable of the talents.
Whatever the method, the attitude is that of a servant, and the goal
remains the same -- to do the will of God."

Mercuriou: "I haven't done the will of God."

Andrea paused.

Andrea: "I don't know about that.  You've made your mistakes, but
you've also said things that needed to be said, and found a platform
from which they were heard.  Now, did you need to steal a billion
dollars to do that?  Did anybody have to die?  I doubt it.  I think
you could have found another way.  This is why I don't buy the
Christians who say you have to fight violently against evil.  First
off, it's un-Biblical -- _resist_not_he_who_is_evil_.  Second, if
there was ever a time when you could have justified a revolution, it
was two thousand years ago when slavery was as commonplace as money,
paganism was the religion of the masses, and Rome was the terror of
the Mediterranean.  Yet Christ didn't condone any revolution; didn't
lead a protest march on the governor's residence; didn't stage a
sit-in at the slave auction.  Didn't do a thing to oppose his own
murderers, and didn't let his disciples oppose them either.  What he
_did_ do was teach; and in the beginning of John is this beautiful
passage about the Word.  'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
was with God, and the Word was God.'  Why the Word?  Because the Word
is the weapon of the Christian, and the flame of God erupts from the
tongue."

Alister: "But if you don't believe in Jesus?  Who's going to listen
then?"

Andrea: "Well, people used to believe the Earth is flat.  You can
believe whatever you want; the fact is that the Earth is round.  Now I
believe that Jesus returned to life after three days in the grave.
It's like the Earth being flat or round.  People can debate it one way
or another, but it's a question of fact, not preference, and
ultimately either true or false.  I think it's true.  The resurrection
was God's ultimate stamp of approval; it was his way of telling us
that we need to take Jesus seriously.  The basic rules are pretty
simple: Love God - unconditionally, and love your fellow man -
unconditionally.  And maybe everyone says something different because
even though that sounds easy, it can be really tough to figure it out
in practice.  Just like our Gospel reading today - easier said than
done.  Amen."



T + 576 days    some anti-government plot must be hatched


Andrea: "Two thousand years ago we were told
_Give_to_all_those_who_beg_of_you_, but half of us still don't believe
that it was God speaking and the other half still don't believe that
he meant it.  Amen."

By the end of the sermon, Alister had concluded that humanity was too
primitive to be flying to Mars, too primitive to have nuclear power,
too primitive to have global data networks, too primitive to have
hypodermic needles, or air travel, or oil wells or cars, and was
genuinely wondering about the printing press.  Mercuriou's thoughts
went in a more predictable direction, which he shared with Andrea in
private.

Mercuriou: "I cooked up some delusional scheme to achieve an
impossible goal.  I ruthlessly stole billions from strangers, got my
two best friends killed, and am going to be sitting in a jail
cell for the rest of my life. I'm a total failure."

Andrea: "Worry about your relationship with God; get that straight
first, and the rest will follow."

Mercuriou: "Relationship with God?  Did you hear what I just said?
You're still taking about my relationship with God?  I don't think
there's much hope left in this life for Marc Mercuriou."

Andrea: "You're looking at the past and the future, and you're looking
at it from a mortal perspective.  Start with the present."

Mercuriou waved his hands, gesturing around him.

Mercuriou: "We're floating in an air-conditioned tube with nothing to
do and no way out.  That's my _present_."

Andrea: "An excellent opportunity for prayer and meditation."

Mercuriou: "I don't know what to pray about."

Andrea: "You just gave me a nice little list!  Forgiveness for the
past; guidance for the future -- two of the most important things for
anybody to pray for."

Mercuriou sneered.

Mercuriou: "Forgiveness?"

Andrea: "Marc, one of the central tenets of my religion is the
_total_forgiveness_of_all_your_sins_."

For a moment, Mercuriou stared at her silently.

Andrea: "To obtain that forgiveness, we are to commit our lives to God."

Mercuriou: "So a murderer, a rapist..."

Andrea: "If the commitment to God is sincere and persistent, yes, but
you're stubborn and opinionated.  You still need to set aside your
material goals and put God first in your life.  You'll still be
stubborn and opinionated, but we can work on that.  First get your
course set straight, then we can trim the sails."

Mercuriou: The two astronauts floated in silence for several minutes.
Finally, slowly, Mercuriou nodded his head in assent.  "What have I
got to lose, right?"  Awkwardly, he clasped his arms around a hand
strap, kneeled against the bulkhead, and was silent.

Andrea: "Do you want me to leave?" Andrea whispered.

Mercuriou: "No." He sighed, bowed his head, paused again.  Finally, in
a low voice, he spoke.

Mercuriou: "Dear Lord, forgive me my sins."

In the next months, he cast himself into writing the words that would
define him.  For he would not be remembered for his flight to Mars nor
his disaster there, not for his rants against capitalism nor his
diatribes against democracy, but for the simple vision that he would
now put into effect.  And, for the first time in his life, Marc
Mercuriou relied on God.

Mercuriou: "If something's going to happen, it'll be any time now.
We're crossing the California coast."

They continued to ride on in silence for a few more minutes.

Mercuriou: "You know, I think I'd rather be dead.  Otherwise, I'll
just sit in prison for the rest of my life.  Who cares if they kill me
now?"

Andrea: After a moment, Andrea answered. "Every foot you set out from
your house could be your last.  I pray that God keep me alive until
I've done his work, and you should do the same."

Alister: "I want to live!" Alister looked back and forth between them.
"What?"

In the cockpit, the flight crew was studying a tire pressure warning.

Reginard: "Does it look like instrumentation?"

McGee: "Nope, it's solid.  Our left rear tires are blown."

Reginard: "Now the left gear is showing a barber pole...  We're getting
a lot of aileron trim, too."

Radio: Heavy with interference, the radio crackled to life.
"_Columbus_, Houston, we see your tire pressure messages and we did
not copy your last."

Reginard ignored the radio, instead pointing to the small yellow lights
that indicated RCS thruster activity.  The right yaw light was lit
solid.

Reginard_McGee_Reginard: "How long's that been on?"  "What?"  "That!"

Back in the Spacehab, Mercuriou was quietly explaining how to overthrow
the government.

Mercuriou: "Anybody can secede.  You need to form a political party.
You should hold a convention to agree on a slate of candidates, but,
finally, you have to convince your people to go somewhere, get out on
Election Day and just _demand_ to win!  It doesn't matter if I'm in
jail.  Or dead.  Change; don't change.  They don't need me.  They
really don't."

A warbling two-tone erupted from the computers.

Andrea: "That's a Master Alarm!  We've lost hydraulics!"

The orbiter spun out of control with a sickening lurch, rolling and
swaying as it careened through the air, uncontrolled now by man or
machine.

Mercuriou: "Tight up!"

Mercuriou and Andrea needed only to snap their visors shut to get
"tight", but Alister's gloves were off.  As he started to don his left
glove, he looked up and caught Vic's eye.  The doctor was floating
leisurely in the middle of the Spacehab, dressed in slacks and a
T-shirt that read "DON'T BOTHER".

Mercuriou: "Vic?!  W-what?  You're..."

Vic: "So are you, Marc."

The orbiter was now swaying up and down wildly, exposing the top of
the fuselage to the direct heat of re-entry once every few seconds.
They heard a loud crash and felt something break loose from the tail.

Vic: "There was a piece of frozen foam insulation that broke off the ET
during launch... smashed a pretty good hole in the leading edge of the
wing, right through all that protective heat shielding."

His words were punctuated by a ear-splitting crack, like half a pound
of linguine snapped in half in front of a microphone.  The cabin
pitched to the side as the entire cargo bay ripped away from the
forebody and the access tunnel torn loose from the crew module,
leaving only a strip of aluminum skin connecting _Columbus_ together
on the left.  Then that, too, tore free, and the orbiter had split in
two.  The lights went out, but they were not long in darkness.  The
forward bulkhead began to glow a deep, but brightening red.

Vic: "This is a good way to go, Marc.  Quick and pretty painless."

The bulkhead blazed white, then morphed into a sheet of flame that
spilled over them, a crushing, foaming ten foot wall of raging red
surf that buried them under an ocean of fire and threw them onto a bed
of coals.  They were burning, Burning, BURNING!! and then their suits
vaporized to ashes which blew away with the flames and left them
hanging in an azure haze.

_Columbus_ was gone, replaced with a thousand blazing brushes painting
fire on sky.  Below them lay America, above them space, and above
space blazed a stupendous light.

Alister: "Wh-what!?"

Mercuriou turned to him as the earth, the sun, the galaxy fell away
beneath them.

Mercuriou: "There is no beginning; there is no end.  This is the Great
Conversation."
