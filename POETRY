When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw,
 1   3    2     4 1     1   1   4    2      4
The line, too, labours and the words move slow.

Not so when swift Camilla scours the plain,
  1    4     241         4    1    4      14     1  4
Flies o'er th'unbending corn, and skims along the main

Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness,
     3    41     4    1    4 1   1    4    4
    Thou foster-child of silence and slow time

Sylvan historian, who canst thus express

    A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:
  1   4    1       4  1    4     14    2    4
What leaf-fring'd legend haunts about thy shape
    1   412     1   41     3   1  3
    Of deities or mortals, or of both,
         1  41   4   1   4    1  4 1 1
        In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?
      4  4   1    4   1   4      1    41      4
    What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?
 4   4     14       4    4  1    1  14
What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?
         4    4     1    41       4    4   413
        What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?

Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard
     1   41        41        1  4   4        4   3
    Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;

Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,

    Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:



It was a cold and wet December day
When we touched the ground at JFK
Snow was melting on the ground
On BLS I heard the sound
Of an angel
New York, like a Christmas tree
Tonight this city belongs to me
Angel
Soul love, this love won't let me go
So long, angel of Harlem

  4  1   1   3     3
Birdland on fifty-three
 1    4     4      1   1 4 1 3
The street sounds like a symphony
We got John Coltrane and a love supreme
Miles, and she's got to be an angel
 
Lady Day got diamond eyes
She sees the truth behind the lies
Angel
Soul love, this love won't let me go
So long, angel of Harlem
Angel of Harlem
She says it's heart, heart and soul
Yeah, yeah (yeah)
Yeah, yeah (right now)

Blue light on the avenue
God knows they got to you
An empty glass, the lady sings
Eyes swollen like a bee sting
Blinded you lost your way
Through the side streets and the alleyway
Like a star exploding in the night
Falling to the city in broad daylight
An angel in Devil's shoes
Salvation in the blues
You never looked like an angel
Yeah, yeah, angel of Harlem
Angel, angel of Harlem
Angel, angel of Harlem
Angel, angel of Harlem
