Ecks: A Christian!  So the thief has converted to God!

Mercuriou: I've done wrong... Yet what I've done and what I haven't
done is beside the point.  I'm done arguing with you, Ecks.  I'm
presenting a plan of action to my supporters and you're not one of
them.  I couldn't care less [CA] what you think of my conversion, my
religion, my politics, or anything else.

Ecks: So we just aren't supposed to talk about your screwball
religion, Captain?

Mercuriou: You can talk about anything you want.  If don't have any
questions about my secession proposal, I'll just turn the camera off
now.

There was a pause longer than the satellite delay.

...

Ecks: You seem to have quite a library, Captain.  I'd like to suggest
a book you may have overlooked.  It's called _The_Wealth_of_Nations_.

Mercuriou: I wouldn't argue with Adam Smith's logic, but I'll argue
against his morality!  Take a look at the beginning of that book,
Chapter 2:

He produced a tablet computer and began reading from it.

   In almost every other race of animals, each individual, when it is
   grown up to maturity, is entirely independent, and in its natural
   state has occasion for the assistance of no other living creature. But
   man has almost constant occasion for the help of his brethren, and it
   is in vain for him to expect it from their benevolence only. He will
   be more likely to prevail if he can interest their self-love in his
   favour, and shew them that it is for their own advantage to do for him
   what he requires of them. Whoever offers to another a bargain of any
   kind, proposes to do this. Give me that which I want, and you shall
   have this which you want, is the meaning of every such offer; and it
   is in this manner that we obtain from one another the far greater part
   of those good offices which we stand in need of. It is not from the
   benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our
   dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address
   ourselves, not to their humanity, but to their self-love, and never
   talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages. Nobody
   but a beggar chooses to depend chiefly upon the benevolence of his
   fellow-citizens.

Mercuriou: Now, is this what we're taught by Christ?  Smith presents a
compelling argument if you're willing to completely ignore its utter
immorality!  The man was another Machiavelli!

Ecks: What's immoral about asking people to pay what something cost to
produce?

Yates: Christ taught us to 'give to all those who beg of you', and
that 'if a man steals your coat, give him your cloak as well'.  Now if
this is how we are to treat thieves, then how should we treat people
who just ask politely?  Not only is Smith's philosophy immoral because
it is based on 'self interest' and 'self-love', but hidden in his
argument is the assumption that everyone actually lives that way.  If
someone adopts the Christian lifestyle instead, she is clearly at a
'competitive disadvantage' because she no longer has the resources
that in Smith's argument are so critical to adjust and balance those
prices.



Ecks: So basically, you want to turn Hawaii into an offshore piracy
haven, where criminals can steal our technology with impunity!

Ecks: How can we compete with a bunch of thieves?!?

Mercuriou: You won't be able to compete because your product is
inferior.  Let's take, for example, Kenya.  Now, what you offer Kenya,
under the guise of "globalization", is a straightforward deal - find
something to sell, something you've got and we want, and then in
return we'll sell you our closed, secret, proprietary technology that
you'll have to pay out of the nose [CA] for.  What I'll offer Kenya is
something else - all the software, the chip masks, the factory
blueprints - everything they need to build their own computers, their
own cell phones, their own data networks.  Now, which of these two
"products" do you think this "customer" will prefer?

Ecks: Freedom for thieves!  That's what you want!  Freedom for thieves!

Mercuriou: What "theft"?  You walk into a museum and take a picture of
the painting, or setup an easel to paint your own copy, nobody calls
that "theft"!  You lift the painting off the wall, put it under your
arm and walk out the door - _that_'s theft!  What you call theft is
nothing more than education, and what you call virtue is a world where
knowledge is a weapon used to maintain an economic and technological
tyranny!  "Give a man a fish, he's fed for a day; teach a man to fish,
he'd fed for life."  Well, the capitalists have a new way - get a
process patent on fishing, then he has to pay you everytime he throws
a line in the water.


Ecks: We need to lower taxes and get rid of government regulation on
private enterprise.

Mercuriou: Then you'll be right back to where you were a hundred years
ago, with massive pollution, key industries run into the ground by
monopolies.

Ecks: "I just can't... I can't believe that an American citizen would
push his own country to the brink of civil war.  I can't believe that
a _patriotic_ American would do that.

Mercuriou (laughing): "You're too much!  All your talk about the
heroes who sacrifice their lives for the sake of freedom!  That's what
it comes down to?  We sacrifice when somebody else's neck is in the
block and then play safe when it's our own?"

Ecks: "You don't believe in those heros, _Captain_.  You mock them
with your voice."

Mercuriou: "Believe in them!  I'm one of them!  I'm willing to fight
for my freedom!  I'm just doing it right here in America, that's all!"


------

and all this bullshit about your "competitors"?!  Who are these people
They're your colleagues, right?  They're the people doing the same
kind of things you're doing, but instead of helping each other, you
try to bust each other's bank account.

------

We need to drive these people out of leadership positions!  Let's
see these capitalists run their businesses without employees!

-------

Hawaii will struggle when it's cut off from the mainland.

Yes, but we need to be independent.  Not just politically, but
economically, too.  States and nations need economic independence, or
political independence means little.  I don't believe in
globalization.  We shouldn't be trying to achieve efficiency through
mass economies of scale because then few places actually develop their
own technology.  We need to achieve global economic independence for
all nations, and that means nations producing their own computers,
cars, buildings and factories.  Hawaii will have to achieve that first
for herself, and then lead the rest of world to achieve it for
themselves.

-------

Why someplace nice like Hawaii?  Why not Alaska?

Alaska can secede, too!

-----

Why should Costa Rica have its own silicon fab?  Why not just import
their chips from abroad?  It'll be a lot cheaper that well.

Well, the answer is that Costa Rica needs to build its own silicon
chips unless it wants to be economically and technologically
dependent on other nations.

-----

Get out.  Don't go to Hawaii.  Just get out.

Why should we go overseas?  (for independence)  We're Americans.
We were promissed freedom just like everyone else.

And how would we obtain political power in Australia?  We're not even
Australian citizens.  How would we even get past their immigration
controls?


--------

I have no interest in working with the capitalists.  I want out of
this country.  I want to live in a society of like-minded people,
people determined to build a gift economy.

Ecks: Hawaiian secession is as crazed as your space launch scheme!
No way it will possibly work!  You'll run out of food!  You think Dole
will just feed you pineapples?  Not to mention energy dependence!
What will your gasoline come from?

Mercuriou: Moving to economic independence will come slowly, but
it has to come.

We're not going to grow nothing but pineapples just to sait the global
demand for the fruit; we will grow our own food.  It

Strike capitalists!  Not just one company or another!  Don't work for
the capitalists!  Refuse to work for these people!  Make sure you work
for people that run charities and co-operatives!  If they are not
willing to abide by the law of charity, then refuse to support them
with your labor!  It's your labor that keeps them in power!

(use the old women and the rich man)

end of the foreclosure mess is when we stop enforcing foreclosures.
Or do like ancient Israel and discharge all debts every 50 years.

-----

------

Are you going to convert all of Hawaii's food production to local ag?

Not necessarily.

-----

I just can't beleive that you don't want to be President.

I assure you that I have absolutely no desire to be President of the
United States.

I just find that impossible to believe.

How can I tell an author what they must do with their work?

Well, I live in a society that has sent armed men busting into my
home!  And now you're going to say, oh, how can I treat these people
so bad?  How can I violate their rights?  Easy!  I've gotten hard;
I've gotten tough!  What I say to the authors and publishers is this:
We are not going to send armed men busting into your homes.  However,
we are also not going to outlaw on-line public libraries; we will not
imprison people for making copies of books; the answer is NO!

"Just say NO!" It is the greatest contribution of the drug war to
human civilization.  That's exactly what we need to do, so many times
in our lives!  That's exactly what we need to do to the majority and
to the capitalists: Just say NO!

----

So people are just, just going to be allowed to copy anything
they want on their computers.

-----

We can't have people sitting around all day doing nothing!

For all your talk about freedom, you really don't believe in it!

-----

Bottom line - capitalism works, in the real world.

OK, so?  It doesn't mean we have to live that way.  Fascism worked;
communism worked.

Communism worked?!

You bet it worked!  In the real world!  It conjured half of this
planet and ruled it for the better part of a century!  Fascism
conjured all of Europe!  It worked!  In the real world!  Look right
here in this country - slavery!  (you don't even have to go to any of
these foreign countries) It worked!  The south built an entire
civilization around it!  It worked - in the real world!  So what?
It doesn't mean we have to live that way!  It doesn't!

I can't believe this!  I can't believe what... so... slavery
just... just... I, well... you just don't care how blacks were
treated?

Oh, I'm sorry, are we now making a _moral_ value judgement?  Sixty
seconds ago, capitalism worked in the real world and that was the
bottom line.  Sounds like that's not the bottom line on slavery.
Sounds like we're going to make a moral value judgement in addition to
this question of whether it works in the real world.  And if we're
going to make moral value judgements on communism or fascism or
slavery, or anything else, then why shouldn't we make them on
capitalism as well?  OK, so what, it works!  Why can't we say
we're not going to live that way because it's immoral, and we
don't care whether it works or not!

No, I am not advocating slavery.  I'm simply pointing out that you can
use the same argument you just used to advocate capitalism to advocate
slavery.  This is so typical of American propaganda.  We don't want to
discuss this issues.  What we want to do is take our opponent's words
and twist them around to (make the advocate what they never advocated)
obfuscate the issues and cripple the dialog.

-----

Include some stuff on propaganda terms - work, 'the people', freedom
and how their definitions are changed around by propagandists.
Propagandists use these terms vaguely so that they can wait for their
opponents to select a tack, then change the meaning of the word to
demolish the opposing argument by a trick.
