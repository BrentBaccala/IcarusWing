Mercuriou and all three of his opponents were back, their four heads
dominating the TV screen in four boxes, Mercuriou on the upper left,
and each opposing corner more determined than the other three to
deride the space captain.  Wye babbled nonsense, unclear to decide if
Mercuriou was defending criminals and capitalists or terrorists and
democrats, but absolutely _certain_ that
_these_people_will_not_get_away_with_this_.  Zee, stony and impassive,
understood immediately that democracy itself was under attack, and
right here in the United States of America, no less!  Yet it was Ecks,
red-faced with rage, and with his hand on the mute button, who was
again the first to speak.

Ecks: "A Christian!  So the thief has converted to God!"

Mercuriou: "Look, what I did was wrong, but there's nothing to do now
but move on.  If you don't have any questions about my speech, I'll
just save some radio power and be quiet now."

This time, he really was reaching for the switch, and there was a
pause longer than the satellite delay.

Ecks: "You seem to have quite an electronic library built up, Captain.
I'd like to suggest a book called _The_Wealth_of_Nations_.  It lays
out our basic philosophy; that a free market economy is the best
method to regulate production in a free society."

Mercuriou: "There's a copy on Gutenberg."

He produced a tablet computer and began reading from Chapter 2.

   In almost every other race of animals, each individual, when it is
   grown up to maturity, is entirely independent, and in its natural
   state has occasion for the assistance of no other living creature. But
   man has almost constant occasion for the help of his brethren, and it
   is in vain for him to expect it from their benevolence only. He will
   be more likely to prevail if he can interest their self-love in his
   favour, and shew them that it is for their own advantage to do for him
   what he requires of them. Whoever offers to another a bargain of any
   kind, proposes to do this. Give me that which I want, and you shall
   have this which you want, is the meaning of every such offer; and it
   is in this manner that we obtain from one another the far greater part
   of those good offices which we stand in need of. It is not from the
   benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our
   dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address
   ourselves, not to their humanity, but to their self-love, and never
   talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages. Nobody
   but a beggar chooses to depend chiefly upon the benevolence of his
   fellow-citizens.

Mercuriou: "Now, is this what we're taught by Christ?  Is this moral?"

Ecks: "What's wrong with asking people to pay what something cost to
produce?"

Mercuriou: "Because you're supposed to 'give to everyone who asks',
even a thief, not turn them away.  That's Luke 6:30."

Ecks: "I'm no theologian; you can direct your religious questions to
the Reverend!  I want to know what's wrong with asking people to pay
what something costs!"

Mercuriou: "Well you can't get away from the religious questions!
That's the whole point!  It's a _moral_ issue!  We are taught by
Christ to make generosity a lifestyle, not an option!"

Ecks: Ecks shuffled some papers.  "So we're supposed to just give away
everything we've got, eh?"

Mercuriou: "Yes, actually!  That's the point of Matthew 19, Mark 10,
Luke 12, Luke 18, and especially Luke 14:33, which tells us that
the cost of discipleship is everything we have!"

Ecks: "Most people have different ideas, Captain.  Most people think
that they can be good, generous hard-working citizens and allocate
their own finances without giving everything away and becoming
homeless beggars."

Mercuriou: "...and they of course expect that everyone else lives that
way, too!  What if someone actually does what Luke 12:33 says and
gives away all of their worldly possessions?  How are they treated
them?  If someone really does what Christ said, she is clearly at a
'competitive disadvantage', so your whole theory of Adam Smith goes
out of wack!"

Ecks: "Well, if they don't want money, if they don't want the
advantages of capitalism..."

Mercuriou: "Capitalism is _unfair_!  It discriminates against
Christians!  You've built a society that rejects Christian principles,
discriminates against Christians, and then claims to offer religious
freedom!"

% MERCURIOU DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THEFT; ECKS DOESN'T WANT TO TALK
% ABOUT CHRISTIANITY

Ecks: "We don't discriminate against Christians!  We don't arrest or
execute them, either; some countries do!  If some deluded 'Christian'
wants to sleep under a bridge, let him!  I wonder if that's true
Christianity, though.  I don't know.  I want to talk about your
screwball secession plan!  First came your idiotic Martian Republic,
and now this!  How will Hawaii survive without the mainland?  Where
will your computers come from, or is everyone going back to eating
poi?"

Mercuriou: "Hawaii will struggle, but she needs to be independent.
Not just politically, but economically, too.  What she really needs,
what we all need, is to turn to God!  Hawaii needs to do that first
herself, and then lead the rest of world!"

Ecks: "Sounds to me like you want to steal Hawaii and turn it into an
offshore piracy haven, where criminals can steal our technology with
impunity!  How can we compete with a bunch of thieves?!?"

Mercuriou: "You won't be able to compete because your product is
inferior.  What 'globalization' offers the world is a simple deal --
find something to sell, and in exchange you'll get our closed, secret,
proprietary technology that we control.  I'll offer them something
better -- all the software, the chip masks, the factory blueprints --
everything they need to build their own computers, their own cell
phones, their own data networks.  Now, which of these two 'products'
do you think our 'customers' will prefer?"

Ecks: "You do that with your technology, not ours!  We'll stop you!
We'll stop you!"

Mercuriou: "Go ahead!  Stop us!  Get tough!  Go to war!"

Ecks: "I just can't... I can't believe that an American citizen would
push his own country to the brink of civil war.  I can't believe that
any _patriotic_ American would do that.  Why someplace nice like
Hawaii?  Why not Alaska?"

Mercuriou: "Alaska can secede, too!"

Ecks started screaming.

Ecks: "Get out!  Don't go to Hawaii!  Get out!!  Just get the hell
out!!  Get out!  Get out!  Get the hell out!"
