Mercuriou: America, I am announcing tonight my candidacy for President
- President of Hawaii.

[ The militant capitalists who have dominated our country for years tell
[ us to "love it or leave it", and that if we don't like how America is
[ run, then we can "get the hell out".  Tonight I say... let's take them
[ up on that offer.

My platform is simple - Hawaiian succession.

[ Those who point to my low poll numbers miss a critical point - I don't
[ need to win a national election.  I don't even intend to try.  I need
[ only to win a _Hawaiian_ election.

Under our laws, American citizens are free to travel anywhere in the
United States and establish residency there.  Hawaii currently has
just over one million inhabitants.  Around three quarter of a million
people are arrested each year for marijuana possession _alone_.  So if
just the people _arrested_ in _one_year_ for _possession_ would pack
up and move to Hawaii, we'd easily have enough people to win the next
election.

Likewise, there are 300,000 registered Greens and 200,000 registered
Libertarians - each alone enough to decide a Hawaiian election if they
were determined to do it.

I'm setting a goal of 100,000.  Abercrombie won with 222 thousand;
Aiona lost with 157.  So 100 thousand doesn't win the election, but it
puts you in the race.  You're a contender.

We need a common platform, broad enough to draw support from more
moderate citizens, while not comprising our core values.  What is it?

First, rejection of capitalism without embracing socialism.
Government is a coercive institution, and you can't force people to be
nice to each other.  Yet words are more powerful than laws.  We'll
seek through LEADERSHIP to enjoin upon our citizens the need to reject
the capitalism philosophy of greed and replace it with the Christian
philosophy of generosity.

So we'll remind our waiters and cooks to feed the hungry.  If they
can't pay rent, we'll ask the carpenters to build them homes.  We'll
ask the farmers supply them produce.  We'll ask our citizens to
support those who base their lives on charity, instead of supporting
those who know mainly the pursuit of money.



One of the biggest challenges we face is energy.  We need energy for
lights, heat, transportation, communication.  We need energy to drive
our machines and energy to - our -.  And we are dependent for that
energy on Arab governments and petro-conglomerates.  Energy, short of
the spiritual crisis of capitalism, is the greatest challenge we face,
because practically our entire society depends on it, and nobody can
claim true political or economic independence unless we have energy
independence.

Without economic independence, political independence doesn't mean
much.  "You have freedom," we are told by the cynics.  "We will leave
you hungry, homeless, ill-clad, without tools or training, but you
have freedom - you can vote in our elections."  It's time to take them
up on that offer, too!

Rather than outlawing on-line public libraries, we will commit to
building and maintaining them, by scanning the books in our libraries
and putting them on-line.

As for the capitalist publishers, they can change their name, they can
change their business model, the people who work for them can go on
with their lives and work somewhere else.  But given the current
business model of these publishers, that information is a weapon to be
locked down and controlled for economic gain, they MUST BE PUT OUT OF
BUSINESS.

We can not - WE WILL NOT - tolerate a future where on-line public
libraries are outlawed!

We need to look at our employers the way we look at our politicians.
We need to always remember that we support our economic bosses with
our labor as surely as we support our political bosses with our votes.
When we are faced with employers with immoral, capitalist lifestyles,
employers who have rejected the gospel of Jesus Christ in favor of the
gospel of Adam Smith, employers who expect their employees to support
this depraved philosophy of social Darwinism, then we must treat them
the same way we would treat aberrant politicians - refuse them our
support by refusing them our labor, by "Just Saying No" when told
that we must work for them!

[ADD SOMETHING ABOUT FREE TECHNOLOGY]

Let me add something - free technology isn't just about
free software, it's about going green, too.  What happens when one of
your capitalist gizmos breaks?  You toss it into the nearest landfill.
Now if the design is open, that device can be repaired.  The
capitalists don't want this.  They don't want technology that can be
repaired.  They want throw-away technology.  Instead of repairing
these devices, they want you to buy a new one.  Going green doesn't
have to be mandated carbon scrubbers on smoke-stacks.  It's building
clean, open, sustainable technology that everyone can build, improve,
and repair.


Now let us turn to our political system.  We've got a lot of problems.
We've built the largest prison system in the world.  Our military is
armed with the most lethal killing machines that have ever been
devised by man.  Our flag has become a target of hatred and oppression
to almost as many people as see it as a symbol of liberty and freedom.

There is one central issue, though, that dwarfs all the others, that
drives all the others - CAPITALISM!  It is one of the most depraved
and immoral philosophies that has ever been proposed by man.  It is a
modern day slavery that has corrupted and co-opted our entire society.
NONE of the other issues can be addressed without addressing it first.

The majority of the American people, those few that are still
listening, are dumbfounded at what they hear.  That the police are not
an instrument of social reform; that goods and services should be
free; that books should be on-line; that capitalists must be driven
out from every post of leadership.  They will never accept this.  They
have build their entire society around rejecting this.  And they are
not going to change.

Those of us who reject capitalism face stark choices.  We can continue
to live in a society where we have no voice, no opportunity, and no
future.  We can trickle out in twos and threes, trying to find
someplace in this world that doesn't exist.  Or, we can unite and we
can concentrate.  We can find a place in this world by making it.
We can win an election in one state, and make that state our own.

We can SECEDE!  SECEDE!  SECEDE!

Finally, let me tell you the three most important things about democracy.

We've been told that democracy gives everyone freedom.  It doesn't.

We've been told that democracy will save the world.  It won't.

Freedom is choosing your own leaders.






I'm open to compromise.  I am serious about secession, but the issue
is not beyond compromise.  We do, however, need serious political
reform to avoid such a break.  Tonight, I propose several
constitutional ammendments to achieve that reform.

1. States shall have the right to secede from the Union.

It is high time we put the mistake of Lincoln behind us.  American
states have no fewer rights than Russian satellites, and the causes of
disenfranchised minorities here are no less noble than of those
oversees.

2. Federal authority, beyond that granted to it in this Constitution,
is solely that granted to them by individual States.

It's unbeliveable to re-iterate what the Constitution already states,
but we're still stuck with this rubber-stamp Supreme Court that
Roosevelt put in in the thirties!

Washington has no authority to regulate drugs, weapons,
communications, abortion or agriculture, to name but a few of its
extraconstutional powers.  However, if states want to maintain
coordinated policy, they are amply able to do so themselves.

Abortion: Some would prefer _granting_ the federal government power
over issues like abortion.  I would rather respect the federal
structure of the union and delegate these issues to the states.

5. Federal authority to regulate patents and copyrights is repealed.

I don't know what the states will do with this power, but hopefully it
will be something better than outlawing on-line public libraries.  I
think that this "freedom" has been so abused by publishers that it
must be abolished completely, but we can leave that up to the various
legislatures.

6. Federal authority to regulate immigration is repealed.

States will regulate their own immigration, and must guarantee
American citizens the right to travel and reside anywhere in the
United States.  The erection of border controls between U.S. states is
an undesirable but necessary price to pay for allowing states to adopt
their own policy on this contentious issue.  Sometimes that's what
best for tough issues.  Promote diversity and hope that the better
ideas win.

Personally, I'd like to live in a state with fairly liberal border
policies.  I don't want to live in a gated community, and I don't want
to live in a gated country.

7. The Citizenship Clause of the 14th Ammendment is repealed.

This is what gives citizenship to babies born in the U.S, a crucial
anti-slavery provision that many civil rights activists will bemoan.
Yet, we now live 150 years removed from the Civil War.  The
Citizenship Clause is crippling our immigration debate by forcing
America to either block immigration or grant citizenship to the
children of anyone who can squeeze into the country for a day.  Is it
more humane to deny citizenship, or to build walls along our borders?
Its repeal will become an excuse for more restrictive citizenship, a
lamentable policy to be avoided.  Rather, we need a more flexible
policy coupled with a renewed sense of the heavy obligation owed by
such a powerful nation to all of humanity, and by such a powerful
species to the planet itself.

4. Juries shall be selected at random, shall witness court proceedings
in their entirity, and shall judge not only the fact, but the law.

The suppression of defense evidence in the prosecution of Jack
Kevorkian was terrifying.  We do not lose our freedom of speech when
we enter the courtroom; in fact, that is often when we must rely on it
the most!  Juries are a crucial safeguard in a system of checks and
balances, and must judge whether a law is just, not mearly whether the
defendant broke the law.

-----

I propose that we organize the Christian Commonwealth of Hawaii, to be
governed by a bicameral legislature whose lower house suffrage shall
be extended to all Hawaiian residents, and whose upper house suffrage
shall be reserved for citizens.  The elections will not be determined
by simple majority rule, but will use a more complicated formula,
similar to the Australian system, to promote representation of
minorities.  The chief executive shall be selected by the Christian
churches of Hawaii, in conclave.  There shall be neither oaths nor
qualifications to hold elected office.

The judiciary shall be strengthened by insisting that juries judge not
only the fact but the law; they are to consider the whole case before
them, taking justice, public safety, reason and mercy into account.
Ending the suppression of evidence, and guaranteeing free speech in
the courtroom will aid in strengthening the juries as well, but let us
not forget the 'hanging jury'.  We also need fair and independent
judges, well versed in the law, ready to limit overreaching
governments or juries.  Both judge and jury must convict.  The law,
the prosecutor, the judge and the jury may each limit the sentence;
only the least of these is imposed.
