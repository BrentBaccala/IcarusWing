Mercuriou: "Good evening.  You first saw me floating in orbit two
years ago, and have never known me any other way.  Soon I shall
disappear into prison, so it seems apropos that I bid you farewell in
this manner."

Mercuriou: "An age has passed and other has come in the brief hours
that we have been apart.  I left a nation confident and at peace and
have returned to one scarred and at war.  Half of my own companions
have perished and our mission seems only able to limp on back home.
Yet here, in the fleet-footed orbital day, I find myself looking
more to the sunrise than the sunset, and feel myself thrilled again
with the joy of youth!"

Mercuriou: "For I see a new nation, rising up out of the ocean as if
in answer to a prayer, a nation conceived in peace and dedicated to
God.  I see a young nation, hewn from the sea by fire and storm,
settled by outcasts from remote lands who sought its yet farther
shores.  I see a nation determined to lead mankind away from its
pitiful servitude to Mammon and into the broad light of freedom."

Mercuriou: "Alas, that nation is not America.  She is committed to the
chain, and only a revolution can break it.  Yet how can we overthrow
the American government?  It possesses the most powerful military in
the world, an able, though largely unnecessary police force, and, most
importantly, a majority of 100 million determined to keep themselves
in power on a game show."

Mercuriou: "We will overthrow them with democracy."

Mercuriou: "Impossible, you say?  Let's do the math.  In the last
election, Neil Abercrombie was elected governor of Hawaii with 222
thousand votes; James Aiona lost with 157 thousand.  If all of them
voted together, they'd have had 379 thousand.  If the whole majority
came streaming out to the polls for the election, maybe they could
barely muster 500 thousand."

Mercuriou: "How much is 500 thousand?  Well, in a nation of 300
million, it's one sixth of one percent!  Furthermore, under our laws,
American citizens are free to travel anywhere in the United States and
establish residency there for one month only before they are allowed
to vote."

Mercuriou: "So, are one-sixth of one percent of us so fed with up our
leadership, so sick of our own lives, so disgruntled with America,
that are willing to set sail for a foreign land and claim it for our
own?"

Mercuriou: "If so, then take Hawaii and get the hell out of this
country!"

Mercuriou: "This will not be an easy path, and many will oppose you.
I will only be able to encourage you from prison.  It will take years
of toil and struggle, and the first years, especially, will be fraught
with hardships."

Mercuriou: "My great mistake was to reject capitalism without knowing
what to replace it with.  Some look to communism; some look to their
religion; I looked to my freedom.  Now that I've met Andrea Yeats,
I've learned to look to _her_ religion, and it is Christianity."

Mercuriou: "My first officer embodies everything that I am not.  When
I took the easy way out and stole, she stood cold and lonely by a
highway on-ramp with her thumb out.  When I set out recklessly for
Mars, she told me that our problems were here on Earth.  And I know
that if all she has is a five dollar bill in her pocket, and a beggar
asks for change, she'll give him the five."

Mercuriou: "Remember that government is a coercive institution, and
you can't force people to be nice to each other.  Yet words are more
powerful than laws.  Seek through _leadership_ to achieve Christian
charity.  Remind the waiters and cooks to feed the hungry.  If they
can't pay rent, ask the carpenters to build them homes, and ask the
farmers to supply them produce.  Support those who base their lives on
Christ, instead of supporting those who pursue money."

Mercuriou: "Do not work for capitalists!  Insist on Christianity.
Tell your boss that you'll give the customers any product or service
for free.  Does he still want you for an employee?  Then work for the
man!  If not, then part with him and his immoral lifestyle!"

Mercuriou: "The majority of the American people are dumbfounded at
what they hear.  That the police are not their pet tool of social
control; that goods and services should be free; that books should be
on-line; that capitalists must be driven out from every post of
leadership; and that they, they, the majority of the American People,
are not entitled to rule over everyone else here!"

Mercuriou: "Those of us who reject America face stark choices.  We can
continue to live in a society where we have no voice, no opportunity,
and no future.  We can trickle out in twos and threes, trying to find
someplace in this world that doesn't exist.  Or, we can unite, we can
suffer, and we can overcome.  We can find our place in this world by
creating it.  We can win an election in one state, make that state a
nation, make that nation our own, and be known forever as Hawaiians!"
