Mercuriou: "Good evening.  You first saw me floating in orbit two
years ago, and have never known me any other way.  Soon I shall
disappear into prison, so it seems apropos that I bid you farewell in
this manner."

Mercuriou: "An age has passed and other has come in the brief hours
that we have been apart.  I left a nation confident and at peace and
have returned to one scarred and at war.  Half of my own companions
have perished and our mission seems only able to limp on back home.
Yet here, in the fleet-footed orbital day, I find myself looking
more to the sunrise than the sunset, and feel myself thrilled again
with the joy of youth!"

Mercuriou: "For I see a new nation, rising up out of the ocean as if
in answer to a prayer, a nation conceived in peace and dedicated to
God.  I see a young nation, hewn from the sea by fire and storm,
settled by outcasts from remote lands who sought its yet farther
shores.  I see a nation determined to lead mankind away from its
pitiful servitude to Mammon and into the broad light of freedom."

Mercuriou: "Alas, that nation is not America.  She is committed to the
chain, and only a revolution can break it.  Yet how can we overthrow
the American government?  It possesses the most powerful military in
the world, an able, though largely unnecessary police force, and, most
importantly, a majority of 100 million determined to keep themselves
in power on a game show."

Mercuriou: "We will overthrow them with democracy."

Mercuriou: "Impossible, you say?  Let's do the math.  In the last
election, Neil Abercrombie was elected governor of Hawaii with 222
thousand votes; James Aiona lost with 157 thousand.  If all of them
voted together, they'd have had 379 thousand.  If the whole majority
came streaming out to the polls for the election, maybe they could
barely muster 500 thousand."

Mercuriou: "How much is 500 thousand?  Well, in a nation of 300
million, it's one sixth of one percent!  Do you see where I'm going?"

Mercuriou: "Under our laws, American citizens are free to travel
anywhere in the United States and establish residency there.  Hawaiian
law enforces only a one-month residency requirement to vote."

Mercuriou: "So, are one-sixth of one percent of us so fed with up our
leadership, so sick of our own lives, so disgruntled with America,
that are willing to set sail for a foreign land and claim it for our
own?"

Mercuriou: "If so, then let's take Hawaii and get the hell out of this
country!"

Mercuriou: "This will not be an easy path, and many will oppose us.
It will take years of toil and struggle, and the first years,
especially, will be fraught with hardships."

Mercuriou: "We'll need a common platform, broad enough to draw support
from more moderate citizens, while not comprising our core values.
What is it?  Simply put, it's everything that I'm been talking about
since Launch Day, right?!"

Mercuriou: "My great mistake was to reject capitalism without knowing
what to replace it with.  Some look to communism; some look to their
religion.  I've learned to look to _my_ religion, and it is
Christianity."

Mercuriou: "My first officer embodies everything that I am not.  When
I took the easy way out and stole, she stood cold and lonely by a
highway on-ramp with her thumb out.  When I set out recklessly for
Mars, she told me that our problems were here on Earth.  And I know
that if all she has is a five dollar bill in her pocket, and a beggar
asks for change, she'll give him the five."

Mercuriou: "Remember that government is a coercive institution, and
you can't force people to be nice to each other.  Yet words are more
powerful than laws.  Seek through _leadership_ to achieve Christian
charity.  Remind the waiters and cooks to feed the hungry.  If they
can't pay rent, ask the carpenters to build them homes, and ask the
farmers to supply them produce.  Support those who base their lives on
charity, instead of supporting those who pursue money."

Mercuriou: "Do not work for capitalists!  Insist on Christianity.
Tell your boss that you'll make it clear to customers that they can
have any product or service for free.  Does he still want you
for an employee?  Then work for the man!  If not, then part with him
and his immoral lifestyle!"

Mercuriou: "Look at employers the way you look at politicians.  Always
remember that we support the first with our labor as surely as we
support the later with our votes."

Mercuriou: "Make a strong commitment to education; it's one of the
best investments possible.  Rather than outlawing on-line public
libraries, commit to building and maintaining them.  To the capitalist
demand that books must be locked down and controlled, only one
response is possible.  Abolish all intellectual property laws!  Demand
public libraries!"

Mercuriou: "Without economic independence, political independence
means little.  'You have freedom!' we are told.  'We will leave you
hungry, homeless, ill-clad, without tools or training, but you have
freedom -- you can vote in our elections!'  Take them up on that
offer, and then get to work on economic independence!  Build free
technology!  Technology that will empower small farmers, produce clean
power, fix our highways, and automate our factories!  Then publish
everything!  Blueprints, assembly instructions, source code everything!
Teach the world how to build America!"

Mercuriou: "Free technology isn't just about free software, it's
about going green.  What happens when one of your capitalist gizmos
breaks?  You toss it into the nearest landfill.  Now if the design is
open, that device can be repaired.  The capitalists don't want this.
They don't want technology that can be repaired.  They want throw-away
technology.  Instead of repairing these devices, they want you to buy
a new one.  Going green isn't mandated carbon scrubbers on smoke
stacks.  It's building clean, open, sustainable technology that
everyone can build, improve on, and repair, and the first step
is make sure everyone knows how it is designed and built."

Mercuriou: "There is one central issue, though, that dwarfs all the
others, that drives all the others -- CAPITALISM!  It is one of the
most depraved and immoral philosophies that has ever been proposed by
man.  It is a modern day slavery that has corrupted and co-opted our
entire society.  NONE of the other issues can be addressed without
addressing it first.  It doesn't matter how many people support
it.  It must be overthrown!"

Mercuriou: "The majority of the American people are dumbfounded at
what they hear.  That the police are not their pet tool of social
control; that goods and services should be free; that books should be
on-line; that capitalists must be driven out from every post of
leadership; and that they, they, the majority of the American People,
are not entitled to rule!  They will never accept this!  They have built their
entire society around rejecting this.  And they are not going to
change."

Mercuriou: "Those of us who reject America face stark choices.  We can
continue to live in a society where we have no voice, no opportunity,
and no future.  We can trickle out in twos and threes, trying to find
someplace in this world that doesn't exist.  Or, we can unite, we can
suffer, and we can overcome.  We can find our place in this world by
creating it.  We can win an election in one state, make that nation
our own, and be known forever as Hawaiians!"
