_Xplorer_One_ began her third full day in orbit amid a jumble of cargo
modules, nearly two dozen of which had now been assembled. The 767 was
docked directly to A-core, the ship's bridge, which contained several
large flat-panel LCD screens along its walls, showing the ship's
position in its orbit, its ground track, and a radar composite
extending two hundred kilometers around the ship.

Alone among the crew, Andrea didn't have any assigned duties, and was
squirreled away in C-3 Electronics Lab, a cargo module that had been
docked the day before. The boxed equipment she left untouched; her
interest lay in a tablet computer connected to the ship's wireless
network. After skimming through the hundreds of documents related to
the ship's design, all the result of Burns' prodigious mind, she found
her way into the ship's library.

It was extensive, numbering well over ten thousand books, completely
electronic, and totally illegal. Every major publisher of technical
books in the English language had been targeted by Burns' super-hack,
and the few books they wanted which Alister couldn't spirit off from
the publishers' computers had been purchased and scanned in by illegal
immigrants. Without launching more than a few pounds of books, most of
these for nostalgic value, the _Xplorer_One_ crew enjoyed easy access
to major reference works on every aspect of technology. There was an
entire book, for example, simply titled _Uranium_, that described
almost everything known about the chemistry of that important element
-- it's dozens of compounds, their properties, the reactions used to
convert between them, and of course its nuclear properties, despite
the fact that the ship carried only a small sample of uranium in its
chemistry lab and Burns had no intention at all of using nuclear
fuel. In fact, all of the major chemical elements were well
represented, with entire books on silicon, iron, and dozens on carbon
and its various compounds. The ship's custom navigation software was
littered with references that hyperlinked directly into a book called
_Celestrial_Mechanics_. There were dictionaries, encyclopedias,
handbooks, and entire scientific journals. There were books on antenna
theory, orbital mechanics, geology, hydroponics, plant pathology, and
Mercuriou's hand-picked collection of literature, both in translation
and in the original tongues.

Almost as impressive was the software collection. Every major
technical product was present, many including all their source code,
stolen from the manufacturer's computers by Burns and Alister. The
scientific software was second to none. In addition to Gaussian and
programs like it, there were sophisticated packages to model and
simulate high-frequency microwave circuitry, the most advanced robotic
control software from Japan, factory blueprints for a complete
semiconductor fabrication plant, and several sophisticated
mathematical packages. The three-pound computer tablet in Andrea's
hand offered the same information that would fill an elite university
library, and the same software packages available at the most
prestigious research centers. The legal penalties for acquiring and
possessing all of it added up to more than a hundred and eighty years
of prison time.

Alister_black: "We've got a pressure drop," Alister announced on the
bridge, as an amber alert window popped up on the LCD screen to his
right. Burns was there, sporting a brand new T-shirt that he had
custom printed months before, but had only unpacked once they were in
orbit. "Why drink and drive," it asked, "when you can bake and fly?"
Mercuriou floated in from his quarters.

Alister: "We're down to 97.4," Alister informed them, reading off the
atmospheric pressure in kilopascals.

Mercuriou: "That's not much," Mercuriou observed.

Burns: "Yeah, but it should be a closed system," Burns answered.

Alister: "97.3," Alister stated.

Burns: "Let's go to Condition Zed," Burns suggested, and Mercuriou nodded.

Mercuriou: "Captain to crew, set Condition Zed," Mercuriou announced
into the microphone clipped to his shirt, while Alister keyed a
command sequence on his computer.  An audible chime sounded throughout
the ship, and the hydraulic doors separating the different modules
hissed shut.

Andrea: "What's happening?" Andrea asked as she watched the door hizz
shut on C-3.

Mercuriou: "We're closing the airtight doors, Dr. Yeats, we seem to have a pressure leak.  Vic, where are you?"

Vic: "I'm in sickbay, of course," the doctor answered, stopping his
inventory of the drug supply.

Mercuriou: "He's got a spacesuit in there if he needs it," the captain noted. "What about Dr. Yeats?", he wondered aloud. Burns was shaking his head, no.

Andrea: "I don't think there's a suit in here," she answered. "All I
see is oscilloscopes and signal generators."

Alister: "We're down to 90 in C-4," Alister declared from his computer
terminal. "Looks like the rest are holding."

Mercuriou: "That's right next to where Yeats is," Mercuriou noted.

Burns: Burns nodded in agreement. "It's probably a micro meteor
strike.  We're not fully assembled yet, so C-4 is in front. But if we
lose 'C' node, she'll be cut off, so we probably want to get her out
of there."

Mercuriou: "OK," the captain concurred, keying his microphone,
"Dr. Yeats, why don't you exit the module you're in and come back here
to where we've at least got a spacesuit for you, then we'll check on
the problem, it looks like it's in C-4."

Burns: "I can open the pressure door from here," Burns added.

He selected a control sequence in the bridge and the door opened automatically.
Andrea pulled herself through it and into a mating node. Burns opened the door
to C-core, which lead back towards the bridge.

But Andrea didn't go there. Instead, she went to the door leading into
C-4, and was about to ask what it's pressure was, when she saw it
displayed on the LCD panel by the door. 87 kilopascals. She knew as a
rough rule of thumb that supplemental oxygen wasn't needed until the
pressure dropped to 70. She keyed the sequence on the panel that
opened the door. Designed to seal its pressurized contents against an
exterior vacuum, it popped open under the force of the higher pressure
outside, accompanied by a whoosh of air flowing into the damaged
node. Andrea's sinuses popped under the pressure change.

Andrea: "I'm going to take a look at the problem in here," Andrea
informed the others as she pushed herself into the node.

On the bridge, the door changed colors on the computer animation of the ship's
layout.

Alister: "She just opened the door to C-4!" Alister declared in surprise.

Mercuriou: "That node appears to be damaged, it's loosing pressure, Doctor!"

In C-4, Andrea could hear a quiet whooshing of air. The node was
definitely loosing pressure. She removed her water bottle from her
belt and carefully squeezed it to release a stream of liquid aimed
straight down the center of the module, then watched to see where it
went.

Meanwhile, Mercuriou had dove to the rear of the 767 and grabbed a spacesuit.

Mercuriou: "Open the door!"

Burns: "Opening bridge airlock," Burns stated in a resigned tone of
voice as he keyed a computer panel. Mercuriou dove into A-core with
the suit.

Vic: "What's going on?" Vic asked over the radio.

Mercuriou flushed red, clenched his teeth, and smacked his fist into his palm.

Mercuriou: "We've got a pressure leak, Vic, and Dr. Yeats, as usual,
is EXACTLY where we don't want her to be!"

Alister: "Aren't you going to prep?" Alister asked.

Mercuriou: "I don't have time! What if she gets stuck in there?"

Andrea released the harnesses on several large packing crates and
moved them aside to follow the trail of the water droplets. A wave of
fear swept over her. _You_have_no_spacesuit_. Calming herself, she
said a silent prayer, _Father,_watch_out_for_me_in_here._

Andrea: "Alister, keep reading the pressure off to me."

Alister: "It's at 82 now. It came back up for a second when you opened
the door, but now it's dropping again."

Burns: "Opening 'B' node," Burns dryly noted as he continued to open
pressure doors in front of the captain, now moving down the central
chain of cargo modules, bumping against walls as he went, partly
because he hadn't fully learned how to maneuver in zero-gee, but also
because he grew ever more irate the further he went.

Meanwhile, Andrea had found the pinhole leak at the root of the
problem. Unlike the space shuttle, designed for manned spaceflight
operations from the beginning, the cargo modules were just large
pressure tanks with cargo containers secured to their side. At times
this meant an inconvenient jumble of conduit that could have been
better designed, but in this case it meant easy access to the
punctured wall of the module. She began looking around for something
to plug the hole with, just as Mercuriou opened the door and propelled
himself into the module.

Mercuriou: "Doctor Yeats, we've got to get a few things clear right now..."

Andrea: "Excuse me... sir," she interrupted as she reached for the
spacesuit and pulled out one of its gloves. Turning back to the
puncture, she slapped the glove against it.

Andrea: "That'll hold until we can patch it permanently," she
announced, then put her left hand on her hip while still holding a
cargo strip with her right.

Andrea: "You wanted to get some things clear? First, no matter how
much reserve oxygen you've got now, it's not enough. Second, it's a
lot easier to find the leak while there's still air in here then with
a vacuum. Finally, bring two suits next time.  It'd really suck if we
both got stuck in here with only one suit between us."

Red-faced, Mercuriou stared at her for several seconds, then turned and left without without saying another word.
