NASA had arranged for the Xplorer_I crew to transfer to the space
shuttle _Columbus_ at the end of a two week scientific mission notable
for including the first Palestinian astronaut, Maj. Hassan al-XX.

"SalƒÅmu `Alaykum", al-XX greeted Mercuriou fervently, kissing both his
cheeks after shaking his hand.







Al-XX sailed over to the galley, opened his personal compartment, and
pulled out a bottle of arak.  Somehow, he turned so that the green,
red and black striped flag on his right shoulder seemed more noticable
than before.

"Captain, you may live the rest of your life as a dog in an American
kennel, but tonight we will behave like men."


"Just out of curiosity, what would be the Muslim solution?  Cut off
his hand."

Al-XX shrugged.  "So what if it is?  Is the loss of a hand too great a
price to pay for freedom?  We have our checks and balances, too."

Husband audibly exhaled.  "I think I like our checks and balances
better."

"Really?!  Let's ask the victim, then - Captain Mercuriou, would
you prefer to lose your hand or spend your life in prison?"

"I think I'd give the hand very serious consideration."

"You see!  And we don't have to waste our tax money on prisons!
But this is 




Al-XX appropriated the arak and now produced a bottle of vintage port.

"More to your taste, Captain?"



"The Jews are theives."

"No anti-Semitic rhetoric in your charter, eh?"

"Of course not!  Americans are thieves - Manifest Destiny, the British
and their Empire, the Germans - Lebensraum, the Russians
with their Warsaw Pact - all thieves!  The Jews are simply the
particular batch of thieves who have stolen _our_land_!"

"Israel is no democracy.  With their racist immigration and their
racist citizenship laws, they're about as much a democracy as South
Carolina was 1860."



"Let's have a different election.  Let every Jew on the planet vote
and let every Arab on the planet vote.  Let's see who wins then."

"Why?  Whose to say my election plan is better than yours or theirs?
Mercuriou's right.  You define your majority so that you win."

"We don't define the majority however we want.  It's defined by law."

"So you didn't right the law yourself.  Fine.  You're the majority,
you're entitled to rule, how dare anyone suggest that the votes should
be counted differently.  Obviously non-citizens should be excluded
from the ballot.  Clearly the State of Israel is entitled to establish
its own citizenship policy.  You think it's all so cut and dry."





You're still talking about ammending the Constitution.  [laughs wickedly]

Here you are in your own book of Revelation: "Noone can conquer the
beast in war, and the whole world worships the beast."  Democracy!
That's it!  That's the beast of Revelation!  It's the most awesome
military machine every created, and everyone thinks it's going to rule
the world!

What about the Israelites?

They're finished!  Finished!  Your own prophasy of the temples!  They
are the states of Israel, and the third temple must be destroyed!  We
will rule again in Jerusalem!




Your religion won't save you!  Your majority don't want religion, they
want freedom!  The majority want to get laid, get rich, and get tough!
Only our religion is tough enough to survive!  Praise Allah!


Andrea: [whispering to Husband] Where did you find this guy?

"Beats me," Husband shugged. "They told us he was a moderate."

"I am a moderate!  If I were a radical, I'd have 30 kilos of C-4 in my
flight kit!"

"I am a moderate!  If I were a radical, I'd have C-4 instead of caviar
in my flight kit!"
