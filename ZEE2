Zee: So I understand that now you're advocating freedom for murderers!

Yates: Yes, I am.  Christ set this example himself.  He walked to
his death and with his dying breath forgave his murderers.

Zee: This isn't Christianity!  Christians are decent, law-abiding
citizens, not a bunch of thieves and murderers and dope heads!

Yates: Don't have sex, don't do drugs, don't drink alcohol, and give
me ten percent of all your money, ehh?

Zee: Christians are obedient to authority, that is made clear in
Romans 13: "Let every person be subject to the governing authorities.
For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have
been instituted by God."

Yates: Romans contains the teaching of Paul, and Paul was not Christ.
Are we to believe that communist authority was from God, or that Adolf
Hitler was instituted by God?  The United States Congress once passed
a Fugitive Slave Act.  Would you have us believe that Christians in
that day were under a moral duty to God to return slaves to their
owners?  We are surrounded in this world by authority that is clearly
not from God.  I prefer to look to First Samuel 12, where the prophet
says "If you will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice,
and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both you
and also the king that reigns over you continue following the LORD
your God... But if you shall still do wickedly, you shall be consumed,
both you and your king."

Zee: We don't have a king!

Yates: Then you shall be consumed, both you and your democracy!  The
point isn't the method of government, it is a warning against the
wicked leadership which abounds in this world!  And a far more
accurate assessment it is than the truckling Romans 13!

Zee: Wicked leadership!  You mean the hop heads and thieves you've
associated yourself with!

Mercuriou: How about this, governor... forget your elections!  I'll
just overthrow your government!  Then you can climb your pulpit and
preach about how I'm the God-constituted authority and now everyone
has to do what I say!

[ Yates: I'll take hop heads any day over a bunch of militants who think ]
[ that 'turning the other cheek' applies to everyone but them! ]

Zee: You don't want _any_ laws!  You want anarchy!

Yates: It comes back to First Samuel 12 - people have to choose to
serve the Lord, otherwise it _is_ anarchy!

Zee: And what about people who don't choose to serve the Lord!
Murderers and thieves, rapists and perverts!  For them we have to have
laws!  What about the victims of these Godless monsters?  Do we just
sacrifice them on the alter of your supposed piety?

Yates: We are the victims, governor, and yes, we choose to accept our
fate.  We choose to love our enemies and pray for our murderers.  For
those who aren't willing to accept that fate, they have the freedom to
live under any other system of government they please - yours, for
example.

[ Zee: How?  You're determined to make your own government! ]

Mercuriou: Genuine political freedom comes not from a ballot box but
from the freedom to travel, coupled with a variety among nations.  If
people are so terrified of these murderers and rapists that they want
your prison state, they can have it - it's just an airplane ride away!

Zee: So the people who don't agree with you, you throw out!

Mercuriou: Well, that's the freedom you've handed us, right?  Once
we're in charge, the people who don't like it can "get the hell out!"
They can "love it or leave it!"  They can "stick an egg in their shoe
and beat it!"


Zee: See, your problem is that you don't believe in democracy!  You
don't think this country can change!  But I've seen it change!  I've
seen the civil rights movement!  If you believed in this country, then
you would lead it to change instead of destroying it!

Mercuriou: Then change!  I'm not stopping you, in fact, I'd love to
see this country change!  But I've seen the choices that its people
have made and the kind of leaders they've chosen!  I'm not interested
in some half-hearted change watered down and opposed every step of the
way by special interests!  I'm not going to keep waiting for the
election, and then the next election, and the election after that!
And I _don't_ see, at all, how I'm "destroying" this country.  Why
does everyone have to move together in lock step?  Why can't one group
go one way, and another group another?  Why should we sacrifice
freedom for the sake of unity?

Zee: The country is at war!  We need unity, not division!

Mercuriou: The country is always at war!  It's invaded and conquered
four other nations just in my lifetime!

Zee: Four countries!  What four countries?

Mercuriou: Granada, Panama, Iraq, and Afghanistan.

Zee: (laughing) Granada...

Mercuriou: Yes, Granada.  We steamrolled over some little nothing
country in a one-day war, but it was still the armed conquest of a
sovereign nation.  And Panama was conquered by the
_very_same_president_ that two years later stood up and told the world
that we were in Kuwait to stop a large country from pushing around a
small one!

Zee: I think the people of Panama have a different version of that
"conquest" - they were glad to get rid of Noriega!

Mercuriou: Right - there are two different versions of international
law, one for democracy, and one for everyone else.  If you're not a
democracy, you basically have no rights.  You can be conquered by an
overwhelmingly more powerful neighbor, and it's a "liberation".  I
don't know why we even bother with international law.  We just do
whatever seems expedient at the moment.

Mercuriou: You talk about unity, but freedom and unity are often opposing
interests.  If I want to walk left and you want to walk right, then
one of us has to sacrifice our freedom to achieve unity.  For me,
the bottom line is that I do not support the leadership of this
country, and therefore I am not willing to sacrifice my freedom
for the sake of unity.



Zee: Capitalism is not immoral!

Mercuriou: Governor, capitalism is one of the most immoral
philosophies that have ever been proposed for men to live their lives.
_You_do_for__yourself_and_let_this_'invisible_hand'_take_care_of_'society'._
It's depraved, not to mention a solid rejection of half the Christian
gospel.

Zee: Capitalism is not about doing for yourself.  If people want to
give to a charity, they are more than welcome to do so.  Capitalism is
about freedom.  It's about giving people the freedom to decide what to
do with their own wealth.

Mercuriou: Govenor, if that's what you want to believe, fine.  But
Christ taught us to 'give to all those who beg of us', and not just
when we feel like it.  There are plenty of people out there who stand
behind a counter and won't lift a finger for anyone unless they're
being handed a credit card.  You can call it 'freedom' or anything
else you please.  I call it capitalism and it is immoral.

Mercuriou: Remember the story of the rich man and the old woman?  The
rich man went to the synagogue, gave a big donation.  The old woman
gave two bits.  Christ then asked which of them went away redeemed.
Now let's stop for a minute and think about this.  How would
capitalists answer?  How would the majority respond?  They would say,
'Look at how much good can be done with that rich man's generosity!
Look how many people can be helped!  He worked hard to earn that
money, now he gives it back!  You can run a soup kitchen for a month
with what he gave!  What can you do with two bits?  You can't even buy
a homeless man a cup of coffee.  The old woman might as well have not
even given anything!'  But what did Christ say?  He tells us the old
woman goes away redemed because she gave _everything_ she's got!  It
was the totality of her generosity that is significant to God, not its
quantity.  So if capitalists would live as Christ taught us, they
would do as the old woman did and give _all_that_they_have_!

Zee: So what are you trying to say?  That Christian morality is based
on giving away all our worldly possessions?

Mercuriou: No, but that's a common misconception, because Christian
morality often _does_ require us to give away all our worldly
possessions.  It is not _based_ on that, though.  It's based on love -
unconditional love, not only for God, but all of mankind as well.
Often that involves generousity, but what's more important is how you
treat other people; generousity is just one of the most obvious
manifestations of that.

Mercuriou: Christ told us that if a man steals our cloak, we should
give him our coat as well.  Now, to put that in a modern context, if a
man breaks into your home, holds your entire family up at gunpoint and
takes everything of value that he sees, you give him the keys to the
car and offer to help carry the stereo out, because it's pretty
heavy.

Zee: You can't be serious.

Mercuriou: I'm completely serious, and so was Christ.  Of course, he
also told the thief some things he doesn't want to hear, either, like
'thou shall not steal'.

Zee: So he told the thief not to steal and he told the rich man to
give his stereo to the thief, ehh?  A little self-contradictory, isn't
it?

Mercuriou: No.  It's two seperate instructions, for two different
people, but it comes down to the same commandment - love your
neighbor.  The thief is told not to steal, for love of the rich man,
and the rich man is told to give up his possessions, for love of the
thief.  Of course, the Christian isn't in either situation - he's not
going to steal, and all the thief needs to do is ask.  So if Mr. Gates
lived this way, all we'd have to do to get the source code for Windows
would be to ask.  He could have been a Christian, instead he's decided
to be a philanthroper.

Zee: Well, the great thing about freedom is that Mr. Gates can be a
Christian if wants to, he could give away all his source code, it's up
to him!

Mercuriou: And does he want that?  Does he 'give to all who beg of him'?

Zee: Well that's his choice.  That's freedom.

Mercuriou: You're dogging the question, sir.  Every murder ever
committed in human history was perpetrated by the freedom of the
murderer!  Every rape, every theft!  Every slave was enchained by the
_freedom_ of his master!  Freedom in the absence of morality is the
single most destructive force this planet has _ever_ seen, and people
talk about freedom largely because they _don't_ want to talk about
morality!  As for Mr. Gates, we've all seen the choices he's made with
his freedom.  We've all seen America's choices.  We've all seen the
choices of the _majority_.

Mercuriou: The path to salvation is narrow, governor, and those who
find it are few.  The path to damnation is broad, and those who find
it are many.  Most people sing their hymns on Sunday and then go work
those jobs on Monday because they need the money, live in an immoral
society where they can't live without it, and have no intention of
just giving it all away to anyone who asks.
