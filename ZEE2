% ANSWERS THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT WHY CAPITALISM IS IMMORAL AND ROMANS 13
% DOESN'T REQUIRE OBEDIENCE TO THE GOVERNMENT.  CAPITALISM COMMANDED (OR
% NOT) BY GOD.

Ecks: "Reverend, do you take Captain Mercuriou's 'conversion'
seriously?"

Zee: "No, I do not.  He has switched from theft to insurrection, not
from Satan to Christ.  We are taught that government authority is
constituted by God, and Christians are to be obedient."

Mercuriou: "Where is that taught by Christ?"

Zee: "Romans 13, it's taught in Romans 13, Captain: 'Everyone must
submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority
except that which God has established'."

Mercuriou: "That's a letter of Paul.  I asked for Christ."

Zee: "It's in the Bible!  If you don't believe in the Bible, you're
no Christian!"

Mercuriou: "I'm a Christian, not a Biblian."

Zee: "The Bible is the inspired word of God.  You're no Christian!"

Mercuriou: "I take the Bible seriously, not literally.  Paul was not
Christ.  He knew God, but he didn't come back from the dead.  His
teachings don't have the same weight, that's why we don't print them
in red.  I don't buy Romans 13."

Mercuriou: "Paul didn't distinguish between governments, he said they
were all established by God.  Jews in Nazi Germany had a moral
obligation to wear yellow stars?  Because it was the law?  Because
their leaders were established by God?  Do Cubans have a moral
obligation not to meet and criticize their government?"

Zee: "So, government is evil, people do whatever they please..."

Mercuriou: "No, but our _moral_ obligation is not to obey the laws of
government, but to obey the laws of God!"

Zee: "Our laws are moral and just!  You're just twisting the Bible
around to rationalize your own rebellion!  Part of the law of God is
obedience to legitimate, constituted authority!"

Mercuriou: "So now we're going to 'interpret' Romans 13, eh?  I prefer
1 Samuel 12, where the prophet says 'If you will fear the LORD, and
serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment
of the LORD, then shall both you and also the king that reigns over
you continue following the LORD your God... But if you shall still do
wickedly, you shall be consumed, both you and your king.'"

Mercuriou: "I say you shall be consumed, both you and your democracy!
This country is wicked, wicked, wicked I say!  It's defiant of God!
You stand behind a counter and refuse to feed people when they come to
you hungry!"

Zee: "Capitalism is _commanded_ by God!  We're not socialists!  You
have no right to tell that man who he has to serve food to!  We've
seen what you want in Russia!"

Mercuriou: "The Bolsheviks were athiests, and I'm not talking about
the government!  The government does not have the right to tell a man
who he must serve.  But Christ did!  He was the Son of God!"

Zee: "Christ doesn't require me to hand a crackhead $20 to blow on drugs!"

Mercuriou: "Yes, he does!", Mercuriou crowed, again taking out his
tablet. "That's what happened to Andrew van der Bijl in 1954:"

   The last round in the game was the most subtle of all. It was December
   30. I had to have my application in the mail that day if it was to get
   to London on the thirty-first.

   At ten o'clock in the morning, one of the students shouted up the
   stairwell that I had a visitor. I ran down the stairs thinking that
   this must be my delivering angel. But when I saw who it was, my
   heart dropped. This visitor wasn't coming to bring me money, he
   was coming to ask for it. For it was Richard, a friend I had made
   months ago in the Patrick slums, a young man who came to the
   school occasionally when he just had to have cash.

   With dragging feet I went outside. Richard stood on the white-pebble
   walkway, hands in pocket, eyes lowered. "Andrew," he said, "would you
   be having a little extra cash? I'm hungry."

   I laughed and told him why. I told him about the soap and the razor
   blades, and as I spoke I saw the coin.

   It lay among the pebbles, the sun glinting off it in just such a way
   that I could see it but not Richard. I could tell from its color that
   it was a shilling. Instinctively I stuck out my foot and covered the
   coin with my toe. Then as Richard and I talked, I reached down
   and picked up the coin along with a handful of pebbles. I tossed
   the pebbles down one by one, aimlessly, until at last I had just the
   shilling in my hand. But even as I dropped the coin into my pocket,
   the battle begun. That coin meant I could stay in school. I wouldn't
   be doing Richard a favor by giving it to him: he'd spend it on drink
   and be thirsty as ever in an hour.

   While I was still thinking up excellent arguments, I knew it was no
   good. How could I judge Richard when Christ told me so clearly
   that I must not. Furthermore, this was not the Royal Way! What
   right had an ambassador to hold on to money when another of the
   King's children stood in front of him saying he was hungry? I shoved
   my hand back into my pocket and drew out the silver coin.

   "Look, Richard," I said, "I do have this. Would it help any?"

   Richard's eyes lit up. "It would, mate." He tossed the coin into the
   air and ran off down the hill. With a light heart that told me I had
   done the right thing, I turned to go back inside.

   And before I reached the door the postman turned down our walk.

   In the mail of course was a letter for me. I knew when I saw
   Greetje's handwriting that it would be from the prayer group at
   Ringers' and that there would be cash inside. And there was. A
   lot of money: A pound and a half -- thirty shillings. Far more than
   enough to send my letter, buy a large box of soap, treat myself to
   my favorite toothpaste -- and buy Gillette Supers instead of Blues.
   The game was over. The King had done it His way.

Mercuriou: "1954! 1954! Not 72 A.D.! 'Another of the King's children
stood in front of him saying he was hungry!' That should posted on the
counter of every restaurant in America, not a VISA symbol!"

Zee: "This isn't the Will of God! You're just a bunch of druggies!
This isn't the Will of God! You're just a bunch of druggies! This
isn't the Will of God! You're just a bunch of druggies!"

Zee seemed stuck on re-re-repeat, so Ecks switched him to the standby
track.

"Well, Captain, you'll be in a prison cell by tomorrow afternoon.  I'm
sure that your plans for Hawaiian secession will go the way of the
Republic of Mars."

Mercuriou: "Check the best seller charts, Ecks.  You don't even know
how well the Republic will do yet."
