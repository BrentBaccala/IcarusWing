% ANSWERS THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT WHY CAPITALISM IS IMMORAL AND ROMANS 13
% DOESN'T REQUIRE OBEDIENCE TO THE GOVERNMENT.  CAPITALISM COMMANDED (OR
% NOT) BY GOD.

Ecks: "Reverend, do you take Captain Mercuriou's 'conversion'
seriously?"

Zee: "No I do not.  He has switched from theft to insurrection, not
from the Devil to Christ.  We are taught that government authority is
consituted by God."

Mercuriou: "Can you show me where that is taught by Christ?"

Zee: "Romans 13, it's taught in Romans 13, Captain:"

"Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for
there is no authority except that which God has established."

Mercuriou: "That's a letter of Paul.  I asked for Christ."

Zee: "So you don't believe in the Bible?"

Mercuriou: "I'm a Christian, not a Biblian."

Zee: "Well, the Bible is the inspired word of God.  If you don't
believe that, you're no Christian!"

Mercuriou: "I take the Bible seriously, not literally.  Paul was the
greatest misionary in the history of the church, but he was not
Christ.  He knew God, but he didn't come back from the dead.  His
teachings don't have the same weight, that's why we don't print them
in red.  I don't buy Romans 13.  Jews in Nazi Germany had a moral
obligation to wear yellow stars?  Because it was the law?  Because
their leaders were established by God?"

Zee: "A dictatorship..."

Mercuriou: "No, Paul didn't say that.  He didn't say that our
obligation to obey the laws depended on the form of government!  There
is nothing in Christ's teachings which gives us some moral obligation
to obey every law promulgated by any government.  In fact, one of the
main themes of _Revelation_ is the presence in this world of
governments that are _not_ ordained by God.  Do Cubans have a moral
obligation not to criticize their government?"

Zee paused for a moment and collected his thoughts.  What had
happened?  Had he in fact converted?

Zee: "So, government is evil; people should do whatever they please?"

Mercuriou: "No, but our _moral_ obligation is not to obey the laws of
government, but to obey the laws of God!"

Zee: "And if you decide the laws are unjust, then you take it upon
yourself to ignore them?"

Mercuriou: "Yes.  That's what people did in Russia, that's what people
did in Germany.  That's what people did here in 1776!  That's what
Rosa Parks did in 1960!"

Zee: "Rosa Parks was a brave woman, and it is true that some laws are
unjust.  Yet this isn't Russia, and this isn't Germany!  We have
freedom in this country, and respect for our laws!  Part of the law of
God is obedience to legitimate, constituted authority!"

Mercuriou: "So now we're going to 'interpret' Romans 13, eh?  What's this
distinction between legitimate and illegitimate government?"

Zee: "Legitimate government is Godly government."

% Mercuriou paused.

Mercuriou: "That I'll agree with.  I'll also say that legitimate
leadership, of any kind, is Godly leadership."

% Zee: That is a socialist philosophy!  or  That sounds like socialism!

% Mercuriou: Is it?  Isn't any form of leadership legitimate only if it
% is inspired by God?

% Now Zee paused.

Zee: "And I'll agree with that."

Mercuriou: "So is capitalism Godly?"

Zee: "Capitalism is _commanded_ by God!  The civil magistrate has a
God-given duty as a minister of justice, and is not to exceed that
duty!"

Mercuriou: "I'm not talking about the government!  I'm talking about
the man who owns the restaurant!  Is it Godly to deny a man food if he
comes to the door hungry!"

Zee: "Send him to a food bank and support it with charity."

Mercuriou: "Why not feed him yourself?  After all, you're running a
restaurant!"

Zee: "Because we are not socialists!  You have no right to tell that
man who he has to serve!"

Mercuriou: "No, I don't have that right.  But Christ did!  He said
'give to all those who beg of you'!  It's the only _Godly_ response,
and therefore the only legitimate leadership!"



Mercuriou: "Is a government dominated by capitalists legitimate?  How
can it be?  How can a government of communists be legitimate?
Communism is a _atheist_ philosophy!  How can atheists run a Godly
government?  It's almost impossible, unless they never apply their
atheist beliefs to any decisions they make!  Likewise for capitalism;
it's _immoral_!  No capitalist government can be legitimate; it's
_impossible_!"


Mercuriou: "We're done talking!  There's nothing left to talk about!
We've talked about this over and over and over again!  The majority of
the people of this country are determined to have capitalism!  It is a
Godless and wicked philosophy!  There is nothing legitimate about
these people or their leaders and no election can change that!  But
this time nobody can say it's a dictatorship!  Nobody can say there
wasn't freedom of speech!  Nobody can say we don't have a free press!
Capitalism is what the majority of the people of this country want!
And those of us who oppose had better get out!"
