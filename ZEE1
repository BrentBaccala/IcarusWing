% ZEE IS GOING TO THE BIBLE.  MERCURIOU DOESN'T CUT HIM OFF, BUT COMES
% BACK TO HIS OWN CRIMINAL JUSTIFICATION.

Ecks: Ecks' final guest on the program was "my good friend, the
Reverend Caiaphas Zee."

Zee: "Thank you, Rich.  Captain, you are a liar and a thief."

Mercuriou: "I've said everything I intend to say on that issue."

Zee: "Then let me say more!  Captain, we have laws not just because
they are made by man, but because they are commanded by God!  We are
told 'thou shall not steal'!"

Mercuriou: "If that's all you want to debate..." [reaching for the switch]

Zee: "Throw the switch, Captain, go ahead.  That's all I want to debate."

Mercuriou paused, then threw the switch.  Nothing.  He grinned.

Mercuriou: "OK, Reverend, so maybe I won't turn you off just yet."

Zee: "There's nothing immoral about capitalism, Captain.  In fact,
Christianity _commands_ capitalism, because the civil magistrate is
not to go beyond his authority to enforce God's laws."

Mercuriou: "God's laws or man's laws?"

Zee: "God's laws, Captain, and the United States has done a fairly good
job over the years of adhering to them.  It's not perfect, mind you,
we still have a million unborn babies slaughtered every year, and all
manner of sexual debauchery imaginable."

Mercuriou: "Yet capitalism is moral... _why_?"

Zee: "Because God does not allow the government to take additional
money to be re-distributed in some way!  We are to tithe ten percent
to the church to support its programs, including charities, and the
government is to tax a small portion more, primarily for law
enforcement.  And many people give quite a bit more than ten percent
to the church, let me assure you.  We have some _very_ generous
members in our congregations."

Mercuriou: "You've got this nightmare of capitalism that's another
slavery all over again..."

Zee: "Capitalism is not another slavery!  We don't bind men in chains
to force them to work!"

Mercuriou: "It is another slavery, Reverend.  It's another depraved
philosophy that has become entrenched in our society; your majority
today, just like the majority in the 1800s, can see nothing wrong with
it, and democracy, once again, appears completely incapable of making
the basic moral value judgements necessary to govern a society!"

Zee: "We did make those value judgements, captain!  Those who rejected
freedom fought against it, but freedom ultimately prevailed!"

Mercuriou: "Freedom ultimately prevailed!  Reverend, the Civil War
shook this country to its core.  Oh, the United States survived, but
the most serious questions raised by slavery have never really been
answered.  Where were all the checks and balances?  Where was the Bill
of Rights?  Where were the noble statesmen, deliberating together in a
free and cooperative government to advance the great banner of
liberty?  If it took the bloodiest war in U.S. history to end slavery,
how much can this system of government really be worth?  And what if
it takes the same thing to end capitalism?  How many more 'successes'
like the Civil War can this country afford?"

Zee: "The Civil War was a success, captain; sometimes you have to
fight for freedom!  The abolitionists tried for many years to work
within that system; but it was too badly flawed.  Finally, one of the
greatest Presidents this country ever produced took a stand for
liberty and freed the slaves!"

Mercuriou: "Reverend, if we had gone to war with Russia over Cuban
missiles, or the Suez Canal, or any other stupid thing, there'd be
people to this day touring the radioactive ruins of Washington, and
New York, and Los Angeles saying it was all worth it; communism had to
be stopped.  People love war, sir, your own Bible has enough of it.
People are greedy, too.  Find those saints of yours and put _them_ in
charge of the government, we know where the majority will lead us!"

Ecks: "Well, our time is growing short, captain, and it looks like our
prison system is going to remain a little short, too.  I don't think
it's worth the expense to apprehend you right now."

Mercuriou now broke out into a long, genuine laugh.  Ecks paused for a
moment, then kept talking.

Ecks: "I suppose there's no harm in leaving you be for now.  You'll
eventually have to come back down.  In the meantime, when you make it
Mars, if you make it to Mars, do us a favor.  Have the dignity to
plant an American flag there.  It's the least you can do for the
country that footed the bill."
