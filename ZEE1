% ZEE IS GOING TO THE BIBLE.  MERCURIOU DOESN'T CUT HIM OFF, BUT COMES
% BACK TO HIS OWN CRIMINAL JUSTIFICATION.

Ecks' final guest on the program was the Reverend Caiaphas Zee, a
prominent Southern Baptist minister who had formed a mega church
empire after a failed presidential bid, and now seemed content to
advise the politicians he could not supplant.  Standing in his pulpit,
clad in his black cassock and starched white collar, he seemed the
very personification of a prophet of God.

Zee: "Captain, you are a liar and a thief."

Mercuriou: "I've said everything I intend to say on that issue."

Zee: "Then let me say more!  We have laws not because they are made by
man, but because they are commanded by God!  We are told 'thou shall
not steal'!"

Mercuriou: "If that's all you want to debate..."

Mercuriou reached again for the switch, but Zee thundered on.

Zee: "Throw the switch, Captain, go ahead!  That's all I want to
debate!  'Thou Shall Not Steal'!"

Mercuriou paused, then threw the switch.  Nothing.  He grinned.

Mercuriou: "OK, Reverend, so maybe I won't switch you off just yet."

Zee: "Thou Shall Not Steal, Captain, _Thou_Shall_Not_Steal_!"

Zee: "There's nothing immoral about capitalism, Captain.  In fact,
Christianity _commands_ capitalism, because the civil magistrate is
not to go beyond his authority to enforce God's laws."

Mercuriou: "God's laws or man's laws?"

Zee: "God's laws, Captain, and the United States has done a fairly good
job over the years of adhering to them.  It's not perfect, mind you,
we still have a million unborn babies slaughtered every year, and all
manner of sexual debauchery imaginable."

Mercuriou: "Yet capitalism is moral... _why_?"

Zee: "Because God does not allow the government to take additional
money to be re-distributed in some way!  We are to tithe ten percent
to the church to support its programs, including charities, and the
government is to tax a small portion more, primarily for law
enforcement.  And many people give quite a bit more than ten percent
to the church, let me assure you.  We have some _very_ generous
members in our congregation."

Mercuriou: "You've got this nightmare of capitalism that's another
slavery all over again..."

Zee: "Capitalism is not another slavery!  We don't bind men in chains
to force them to work!"

Mercuriou: "It is another slavery, Reverend.  It's another depraved
philosophy that has become entrenched in our society; your majority
today, just like the majority in the 1800s, can see nothing wrong with
it, and democracy, once again, appears completely incapable of making
the basic moral value judgements necessary to govern a society!"

Zee: "We did and do make those value judgements, captain!  Slavery was
against God's commandment to love one another!  Those who rejected
freedom fought against it, but freedom ultimately prevailed!"

Mercuriou: "Freedom ultimately prevailed!  Reverend, the Civil War
shook this country to its core, and the most serious questions have
never really been answered.  Where were all the checks and balances?
Where was the Bill of Rights?  Where were the noble statesmen,
deliberating together in a free and cooperative government to advance
the great banner of liberty?  If it took the bloodiest war in
U.S. history to end slavery, how much can this system of government
really be worth?  And what if it takes the same thing to end
capitalism?  How many more 'successes' like the Civil War can this
country afford?"

Zee: "The Civil War was a success, captain, however bloody it may have
been; sometimes you have to fight for freedom!  The abolitionists
tried for many years to work within that system; but it was too badly
flawed.  Finally, one of the greatest Presidents this country ever
produced took a stand for liberty and freed the slaves!"

Mercuriou: "Reverend, if we had gone to war with Russia over Cuban
missiles, or the Suez Canal, or any other stupid thing, there'd be
people to this day touring the radioactive ruins of Washington, and
New York, and Los Angeles saying it was all worth it; communism had to
be stopped; freedom had to prevail.  People love war; your own Bible
has enough of it.  People are greedy, too.  Find those saints of yours
and put _them_ in charge of the government, we know where the majority
will lead us!"

Zee: "What's your solution, captain, overthrow any government whose
laws you don't like?"

Mercuriou: "You look somberly at the laws, and look somberly at the
men who make the laws, and come to a conclusion that the men are
self-serving materialists consumed with their economic and political
theories of capitalism and democracy, and that their laws are
convoluted, misguided, and unjust."

Zee: "Convoluted, misguided, and unjust?"

Mercuriou: "Well, look at them.  Go into any law library and ask to
see the law.  Just the Code of Federal Regulations alone takes up
entire shelfs!  It's tens of thousands of pages of inscrutable
legalize.  And people say that 'ignorance of the law is no excuse'; I
personally think it's a great excuse - who understands all these laws?
That's convulted.  As for misguided, well, look at how much of it is
to somehow 'regulate' people's greed - this capitalist idea that we
use the law to build some kind of a 'playing field'.  And unjust!
You've got to be kidding me!  One guy cuts a deal to testify against
his friends and gets four months; another guy refuses to snitch and
it's a ten year sentence!  You call that justice?"

Zee: "Many people would agree with those criticisms, captain; perhaps
you should have given our political system more of a chance and become
a politician instead of a thief!"

Ecks interrupted before Mercuriou could fire back.

Ecks: "Well, our time is growing short, captain, and it looks like our
prison system is going to remain a little short, too.  I don't think
it's worth the expense to apprehend you right now."

Mercuriou now broke out into a long, genuine laugh.  Ecks paused for a
moment, then kept talking.

Ecks: "I suppose there's no harm in leaving you be.  You'll eventually
have to come back down.  In the meantime, when you make it Mars, if
you make it to Mars, do us a favor.  Have the dignity to plant an
American flag there.  It's the least you can do for the country that
footed the bill."
