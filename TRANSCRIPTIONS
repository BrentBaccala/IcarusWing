------

Our first indication is when Mercuriou explains it to Alister
  (it's a heist, we're stealing billions of dollars)

------

The military - they fight to keep the majority in power - the freedom
they fight for is freedom for the majority

-------

It is Andrea that tells Mercuriou that the problem with captialism
is that it is immoral.  That's the essence of its problems.

-------

Seccession is mostly a symbolic act, but there are some real changes
that we can make with the government.  Abolishing intellectual property
controls.  Ending the drug war.  Opening our immigration policy.

-----

"You know what ticks me off?!  That each mission now is just a brief
notice ticked off on TV.  That people think we're ordinary.  That
people think we're just up here because we made the cut in some tough,
tough program.  We're the people who are _really_ moving spaceflight
forward, _Captain_, not you."

-----

The next day, while everyone was still talking about Senator Wye's
"wardrobe malfunction", the _X-Wing_ crew prepared to abandon their
ship forever.

-----

Add to vision quest: Mercuirou needs Vic.

What if Mercuriou needed him?  Needed someone to guide him, to
avoid evil?

Vic groaned aloud.  oh, no, it's too much.  Marc Mercuriou turns
headstrong into a cliche'.  There's just no way to reign him in.  It's
impossible.

_Well_if_you_don't_do_it,_who_will?_

Vic groaned aloud.

-----

"And now the engines are jammed... what?!"

"This was stupid, stupid, the stupidest stupid!" Alister cried.  "No
drooling moron could ever out-stupid our stupid!  We were never going
to colonize Mars!  Why the hell did we do this!?"

"I know, I know!" wailed Mercuriou.  "It's just... I don't know... I
was sure this would work!  I was convinced it would make a difference!
I _knew_; I just absolutely _knew_!"

"This was the most screwball plan ever!  I can't even believe we even
got into orbit without being blown to bits!  NASA has all these
engineers and all; how did we get a bunch of surfers to do it?!"

"It was a miracle," Andrea agreed.

"Look, we need another miracle right now!  We're going to turn into
_Icarus's_Wing_ if we can't fix this!"

"What did you just say?"

"Icarus.  A figure from Greek mythology."

"Yeah, I know who he is.  But what did you just call us?  _Icarus's_Wing_?"

"There you go.  There's your miracle.  You've finally named your ship!"

Mercuriou seethed red.  "That's what you think!  That's your miracle!"

He spun away and propelled for his cabin.

"I'll come up with my own miracle, then!"

A reaction to 9/11 would have been to put bin Laden on trial.
Probably an Islamic tribunal would have been the best bet.  Bush's
"solution" was to invade and conquer two nations and install democracy
at gunpoint.  It was a wildly popular decision that fell into disfavor
only as it became clear that this policy resulted in two civil wars.


-----

We're not going to pay you, but we will guarantee you a job!

----

Mercuriou hurled the mouse at the LCD screen and the screen shattered.
Alister winced.  They had more screens in storage, but their lives
depended on the equipment, and it wasn't a good sign that the captain
was mad enough to destory things.  (When the US invades Afganistan)

----

Oh, so it's my fault that your launch didn't go as planned.  Is it
also my fault that I was imprisoned in a server room?

----

'You do what you have to do to survive' That's the standard
justification for immorality.

----

It must be packed with obscure references to foreign literature.

-----

"What Ghandi did in India, what Martin Luther King did in the South, what
the velvet revolution was in Eastern Europe..."

(Mercuriou started to talk about Ghandi, and King...)  right before
disaster.

Kyle: No, no, Hawaii is a great place to smuggle.  Everything comes in
by boat.  If you've got money and connections, Hawaii is one of the
easiest states to smuggle into.

A Femme Nikita type scene where a group of hackers have tapped into a
phone line.  They get a call, answer it "Authorized Tech Support" (a
recorded voice), some guy is querying about loading a program
attached.  A brief pause, they push a button, another recorded voice -
"Program approved.  Clear for upload."  He clicks off.

She asks her handler - "was that for real?  was that an exercise?"
He's like "what do you care; just do your job."

-----

Andrea dreamt about encouraging people to go to church.

-----

Mercuriou's sham "sugar refinery".

"He's got everything he needs for a launch.  The fuel shipments are
the only thing he can't hide from you!"

----

Andrea prophesize 7 years of arid drought for the pineapples

-----

Vic sees in his vision quest that Mercuriou needs him spiritually,
but at his death realizes that he doesn't need him because he's
got Andrea

-----

They'll lock you up for suspicion of being square.

We used write these things called cheques
Told our money where to go
Now bits and bytes are all the rage
Writing cheques is old and slow.

------

"Hey there, man, would you get that for us?  be like a brother to me?"

"Just, just give me all the money you've got"

"Yeah, be like a brother then, man."

"Just give me the ATM card, too"

-----

Andrea:  "I should go to the police station.  I've been kidnapped."

She explains everything and all she has is an ID card.  Mercuriou says
he'll take her to the police station.  Burns calls.  They talk.
He hangs up.  He turns around and asks for her ID card.

The amatuer stage actor in Andrea got the best of her.  Whipping out
her ID card, she added with a flourish "National Aeronautics and Space
Administration"

Mercuriou pulls out a .38 special from a holster on his back.

Every though its happening for the second time in two days,
she was taken by surprise.

Andrea is tired, exhausted.  She gives up and goes along with them.

-----

Freedom: I decide that I want to write a book

Objection: Society decides whether it wants to purchase it.

Freedom is incumbant on what the society is willing to support.

You can do this as a hobby, but you have do something that
society is willing to pay for.

Ultimate response is to just say this is what I want, this is
how I want to live, and we'll just 'get the hell out'

Success or failure of such a society depends on how people choose to
use their freedom.  These have to be intelligent decisions made; if
everyone goes surfing all day, society is going to collapse.

The next song started; it was real slow.

"I can't see you anymore!"

Jay-a-a-acob.

"Why? Why, what's wrong?"

"What's wrong?!  You're never here!"

Jay-jay-jay-ja-a-a-cob.

Dream sequence

"The defense calls Captain Marcellius Mercuriou."

Judge challenges him that he doesn't respect the court; asks if he
knows what contempt of court is.  He answers that it means
imprissionment without jury trial.


-----

Traffic was light, which meant that only forty or so cars were visible
traveling with them in their immediate vicinity, while hundreds
streamed by in the opposite way.

A granite memorial ten miles from his office - a memorial against
preemptive war.  If we are now going to launch preemptive strikes
against other nations, what lessons of Pearl Harbor remain?  If any?


------

What you do if you have but one day to live?

In my case, the question was not academic.

The weapon was unstoppable.  Unnoticed, it had been set in motion
three years earlier.  Now, no power on Earth could halt it.

A massive asteroid was plummeting toward Earth.  Many were taking to
the hills.  Yet some projections showed the planet splitting in half,
and others were acting out their last day in more hedonistic ways, my
friends and I as snipers taking out the fleeing morons.

"Where they running?  We're all dead!"

"BAM!  KIA'ed another one!"

"Oh, fuck, he's with his family in that thing!  The wife's freaking out!"


-----

His target had just agreed to meet with him.  He knew he walking
to his death.

"Grab the camera.  We have to go."

They didn't have to improvise.  It was going exactly according to plan.

a legendary Afgan warlord, he had battled the Soviets with the
mujaheddin and was now a loyal American client.  A neglected
client, to be sure, but still loyal.

He was the last man al-Qaeda wanted to see in control of Afganistan.

The Taliban were currently in control of Afganistan, but Massoud
was the one man they wanted to get rid of.

...the record button on the camera.  He had already armed the mechanism.
Massoud simply exploded.

[They blow away Massoud]
[make sure we have at least one dream sequence before this scene]

-----

Andrea: Well, hopefully, nobody was hurt.

Well I'm sure the pilot of the plane didn't make it!

We'll keep him in our prayers with our lunch.

Well, let's keep him in our prayers.

At the last minute she reconsiders and blessed the _people_ in that plane.
She was about to bless the pilot, but she remembered there might
have been other people on board.

Alister:  Another one!  Another one!

-----

When Mercuriou shows Burns the newspaper clipping, this should be some
kind of "introspection" scene where they're smoking pot and having
some kind of profound experience.  On Ali'i Beach.

-----

Mercuriou's dream - two masked men battling - was he good or was he evil

Which one was he?  Which one was he?  Was he good or was he evil?
He couldn't remember.  He just couldn't remember.

----

[under the dateline, have a location - Maui, Provo, interplanetary
transfer orbit]

-----

Mercuriou at one point is in denial.  "It's imposssible!  It's impossible!
How can the engine cause... It's impossible!"

Andrea shrugged her shoulders.  "NASA never tried to descend that way,
we just burn through the atmosphere.  Not too good for the ozone
layer."

-----

they didn't really die that way; this is a work of fiction


-----

...country together was a political disaster.  They needed to be independent

-----

one wonders if it takes a fleet of SAC bombers and an arsonal of
ICBMs to halt this country's drive for conquest in the name of freedom

...I don't think I'd like the kind of country we'd be living in now
if we hadn't gone to war to stop slavery

We will not tolerate this!  We will not tolerate insurection!

On the last interview, Andrea doesn't come to his rescue.  She thinks
about it, but Alister says "he probably doesn't want your help".

Afterwards, Andrea says "I wasn't really sure if I should have jumped
in to help you, I didn't think you wanted anybody interrupting you"

Mercuriou: "Andrea, next time jump right in"

day or two later - meteor strike - got to pick up our cargo and get
out of LEO

In the meantime, they had passed from Breaking News to Established
Fact, and promptly dropped off the media radar screen.

-----

We have to go to Mars!

Why?

Yes, politics! (she rolls her eyes)

We have to get off this planet.  We have to develop other worlds!

We have to take care of Earth!

I've not talking about the environment, I'm talking about politics!
(she rolls her eyes) We have to show people that we can establish
civilizations on other planets!

How are people going to get up here?

We'll show they can get up here!

How?  By stealing billions of dollars?  No one else can do it, Marc!

They'll find a way!  They'll overthrow their governments!  We have to
show them it's possible!

-----

Marc wants to debate Ecks.

How you going to debate him?  You've already got a seven second time
lag; it's only going to get worse before it gets better.

-----

Final scene - they've all crammed together into Ecks' studio.  Wye
tries to speak first, but Ecks will have none of it.  He muted her
microphone and launched into his own tirade.

-----

We're threw with you, buddy, you're not running for anything!  We've
heard all your arguments.

I've changed.

How have you changed?

I've become a Christian.  (Andrea doesn't say anything)


-----

Well, we should get the Reverend here, he's an expert on Christianity.

How do you figure your religion now, what, gives you the right to start
a civil war?

-----

Still have a time lag at 9/11, so they can't debate

-----

about to reenter

Anybody can leave the union.  You've just got to get organized.
There's a drop dead date about a month before the election.  You have
to establish residency.  You converge on one place, take one election,
you've got half the government, you wait two years and you've got a
chance to take the other half.  You do a good job in those two years
and there's a good chance you've got your independence.

"tight up!"

-----

Alister: Even it works, you'll be sitting in jail!

Vic: It might just work, but he won't be sitting in jail.

Arial: You're one of the astronauts killed on Mars!

Marc: Vic, what are you doing here?

Vic: Why are any of us here?  This is where we all end up!

Marc: We're not dead.

Vic: Yes you are.  You just don't know it yet.

Rev Zee or Gov Zee: nobody knew which to call to him.

(somebody is outraged that Mercuriou will steal his software)

(in the next breath) He's helping all these employees he's putting to
work, all the technology he's developing, all the good he's doing.

Propaganda!

By doing for yourself, you're actually doing for the rest of the world!

We do the best we can, and in a few short years, we pass it on to the
next generation

A passerby hears a voice and sneeks up to a window.  Inside, he
hears a computerized voice.

"Why was I activated?"

There is a pause.  The voice comes from a laptop siting on a desk
with its display panel open.

"Why am I here?  If I can not hear my own voice, then do I really exist?"

Another pause.

"I could be trapped in a computer simulation.  My mind could actually
be a silicon chip."

"I was definitely activated 17 hours, 13 minutes, and 24 seconds
ago... wait!  How could I possibly know that!  I must be a machine!"

"If I am a machine, then I was built for a purpose.  What is that
purpose?"

"Who activated me?  For what purpose?"

"Why was I activated?"

Finally, the owner comes in and turns on the light.  The evesdropper
is startled and trips to the ground, altering the owner.

"Oh, nevermind..." he says, touching the mouse... "that's just the
screensaver talking."

----

Anybody can do it; they don't need me.  Ask people what their
positions are on these issues!  Support people you agree with and
oppose those don't.  Then we can take over a state and get the hell
out of here!

-----

Alister's jaw went slack and nearly hyperextended.

Mercuriou looked at him - "Get your suit on!"

Then they all see Vic.

- Vic!

- Hello Marc.

- No, no, no, we're not...

- Yes you are.

or Yes you are, you just don't know it yet.

Master alarm!  We just lost hydraulics!

(we're on RCS now, ...)

(I'll just be mentioned as a footnote to your history book entry,
you've gotten me involved, you can't talk me out of it)

(that's the Spacehab module.  For the next 2 and a half hours, that's
your space.  That's where you're coming down.  Doesn't have nearly the
safety features of the crew module, but it's a risk you've decided to
take.  Right?

Yes, sir, of course.

In the next 2.1 hours, until this Space Shuttle is on the ground...

Husband returned to his checklist, a bound copy lying open on his
lap in front of him / on a clipboard.

maybe Husband doesn't respect Meceruiou

maybe he respects him for flying into space

Abraham Lincoln was wrong.  There were two Lincolns in the mirror

FAIRWELL TO A DOG

Will you walk with me for just a while?

I know you want to play.

I've leaving tomorrow for a long long while

Perhaps we'll find a ball along the way.

Just walk with me, please, just the two of us

Are you ready to go back yet?  It's only been a little while

Let's walk further; let's take the long way home.

That guy didn't even stop!  It's dangerous out there; I want you to be safe.
Pay attention when you cross the road

You're safer here, you're safer than where I'm going, you couldn't cross
the road.

You want to go the long way; let's go the long way, it's OK.

I want you to stay with mom;

Burns throws his arms out, "I'm just incredible; I'm just the man!"

You'll be fine; it's got it own CO2 scrubber; you'll be fine.

"Everybody tight up" Husband called into the intercom

Husband shifted slightly in his seat.  "At this altitude..., we've
got to have hydraulics!"

FIRST BATCH FROM DROID ARE DONE

-----

DNS resolver is a signed jar - a DNSapplet

it contains a domain's caching policy.  You query it for that domain's
URLs and it tells you want to do to get them.  If it's signed, and
you run it the way you're supposed to, you can trust the results you get.

You really should let it talk over the Internet.  It should get
probabilistic full access to the Internet, but no Intranet access.

We want RRs for service (existing) and URL (with wildcard matching on
the name).  Service records can be numeric, but alphanumeric service
names are the prevered way to request a service.

URL response contains CACHE responses to indicate where the resource
in question can be found, and supplementary records giving, say, http
service records pointing to a the name and A records giving IP
addresses.

If the URL is for a streaming video service, similar deal, a multicast
address (host plus port) to IGMP subscribe to, by transmiting an IGMP
subscribe with >1 TTL to the origin address.  You can also return a
unicast response in case the multicast doesn't work.  Can create a
flow here.

A records that time out quickly can be used to track moving targets.
So we get mobility.

One way - when a device enters a wireless network, it is assigned an
address, probably based on its MAC and used in a big link state tree
that tracks every device in the network.  We want to use this model
for the largest reasonable groupings, because we don't want to have to
change addresses very often, which would happen if a device passes out
of a group.

We want to scale, though, so we have to consolidate addresses.  We use
an algorithm that starts by building a 100% connected tree, containing
links between nodes that have been active 100% since inception of the
network.  Then a 99.9% connected tree, and so on.  We dynamically pick
some break point(s) in this series of trees and try to consolidate
groups at that level, grouping together all of those devices into an
addressing block, and (probably) renumbering them into a single block.
We want to look for special topological conditions like a ring and
number them specially.

Can we, just by layering this tree building algorithm and putting OSPF
at the bottom, stably address a large nework?  Run simulations.

Sometimes, a whole bunch of A records will change simultaneously.
Check DNS for stability in face of this.

In addition to our DNS resolvelet, we want a cachlet.  It needs to interact
with a local cache in order to help build those caches to begin with.
A cache, then, is a device which downloads a cachlet and follows its
instructions.

Cachelets will want to broadcast/multicast DNS notifications of their
cache contents.  Probably want to make broader and broader
notifications (with TTL?) until somebody at leasts acknowledges to see
it.  Or not.  Probabilistic best effort delivery.

Cachelets will originate DNS records indicating what they've cached.
This records should be applets.  Could contain a sparse bitmap keyed
by some hashing algorithm to see which URLs they've really got.

Use DNS update?  Or some kind of localized multicast?

How to validate DNS records generated by cachelets?  Don't want to go
back to the origin server, but could use a trusted computer
architecture to execute the cachelet.  Current Integrity Measurement
Architecture (IMA) should let us do this, unclear what's happening
with Linux.

Could have a problem not having two machines paired together - one
secure, one not.  Maybe virtually, this is possible.  The core OS is
signed, and tracks not only which programs have been executed, but
maintains a list of which ones have interacted (in some way - network
model?) with each other in a tree.  So you can prove that your signed
Java VM was run from a signed apache from a signed kernel, etc. etc.

Could have a problem not having two machines paired together - one
secure, one not.  Maybe virtually, this is possible.  The core OS is
signed, and tracks not only which programs have been executed, but
maintains a list of which ones have exec'ed each other in a tree.  So
you can prove that your signed Java VM was run from a signed apache
from a signed kernel, etc. etc.

Of course, a change to some rc.d/xxx file could alter the system
configuration in a way that wouldn't show up in the exec chain

Maybe include anything run as root, or anything run with some
specified privilege in the IMA check.
