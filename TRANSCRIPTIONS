Our first indication is when Mercuriou explains it to Alister
  (it's a heist, we're stealing billions of dollars)

------

The military - they fight to keep the majority in power - the freedom
they fight for is freedom for the majority

-------

It is Andrea that tells Mercuriou that the problem with captialism
is that it is immoral.  That's the essence of its problems.

-------

Seccession is mostly a symbolic act, but there are some real changes
that we can make with the government.  Abolishing intellectual property
controls.  Ending the drug war.  Opening our immigration policy.

"You know what ticks me off?!  That each mission now is just a brief
notice ticked off on TV.  That people think we're ordinary.  That
people think we're just up here because we made the cut in some tough,
tough program.  We're the people who are _really_ moving spaceflight
forward, _Captain_, not you."

-----

The next day, while everyone was still talking about Senator Wye's
"wardrobe malfunction", the _X-Wing_ crew prepared to abandon their
ship forever.

-----

Add to vision quest: Mercuirou needs Vic.

What if Mercuriou needed him?  Needed someone to guide him, to
avoid evil?

Vic groaned aloud.  oh, no, it's too much.  Marc Mercuriou turns
headstrong into a cliche'.  There's just no way to reign him in.  It's
impossible.

_Well_if_you_don't_do_it,_who_will?_

Vic groaned aloud.

-----

"And now the engines are jammed... what?!"

"This was stupid, stupid, the stupidest stupid!" Alister cried.  "No
drooling moron could ever out-stupid our stupid!  We were never going
to colonize Mars!  Why the hell did we do this!?"

"I know, I know!" wailed Mercuriou.  "It's just... I don't know... I
was sure this would work!  I was convinced it would make a difference!
I _knew_; I just absolutely _knew_!"

"This was the most screwball plan ever!  I can't even believe we even
got into orbit without being blown to bits!  NASA has all these
engineers and all; how did we get a bunch of surfers to do it?!"

"It was a miracle," Andrea agreed.

"Look, we need another miracle right now!  We're going to turn into
_Icarus's_Wing_ if we can't fix this!"

"What did you just say?"

"Icarus.  A figure from Greek mythology."

"Yeah, I know who he is.  But what did you just call us?  _Icarus's_Wing_?"

"There you go.  There's your miracle.  You've finally named your ship!"

Mercuriou seethed red.  "That's what you think!  That's your miracle!"

He spun away and propelled for his cabin.

"I'll come up with my own miracle, then!"

A reaction to 9/11 would have been to put bin Laden on trial.
Probably an Islamic tribunal would have been the best bet.  Bush's
"solution" was to invade and conquer two nations and install democracy
at gunpoint.  It was a wildly popular decision that fell into disfavor
only as it became clear that this policy resulted in two civil wars.


-----

We're not going to pay you, but we will guarantee you a job!

----

Mercuriou hurled the mouse at the LCD screen and the screen shattered.
Alister winced.  They had more screens in storage, but their lives
depended on the equipment, and it wasn't a good sign that the captain
was mad enough to destory things.  (When the US invades Afganistan)

----

Oh, so it's my fault that your launch didn't go as planned.  Is it
also my fault that I was imprisoned in a server room?

justification for immorality.

It must be packed with obscure references to foreign literature.

the velvet revolution was in Eastern Europe..."

(Mercuriou started to talk about Ghandi, and King...)  right before
disaster.

A Femme Nikita type scene where a group of hackers have tapped into a
phone line.  They get a call, answer it "Authorized Tech Support" (a

attached.  A brief pause, they push a button, another recorded voice -
"Program approved.  Clear for upload."  He clicks off.

She asks her handler - "was that for real?  was that an exercise?"
He's like "what do you care; just do your job."

-----

Andrea dreamt about encouraging people to go to church.

-----

Mercuriou's sham "sugar refinery".

"He's got everything he needs for a launch.  The fuel shipments are
the only thing he can't hide from you!"

Andrea prophesize 7 years of arid drought for the pineapples

Vic sees in his vision quest that Mercuriou needs him spiritually,
but at his death realizes that he doesn't need him because he's
got Andrea

Told our money where to go
Now bits and bytes are all the rage
Writing cheques is old and slow.

"Hey there, man, would you get that for us?  be like a brother to me?"

"Just, just give me all the money you've got"

"Yeah, be like a brother then, man."

"Just give me the ATM card, too"

-----

Andrea:  "I should go to the police station.  I've been kidnapped."

She explains everything and all she has is an ID card.  Mercuriou says
he'll take her to the police station.  Burns calls.  They talk.
He hangs up.  He turns around and asks for her ID card.

The amatuer stage actor in Andrea got the best of her.  Whipping out
her ID card, she added with a flourish "National Aeronautics and Space
Administration"

Mercuriou pulls out a .38 special from a holster on his back.

Every though its happening for the second time in two days,
she was taken by surprise.

Andrea is tired, exhausted.  She gives up and goes along with them.

Freedom: I decide that I want to write a book

Objection: Society decides whether it wants to purchase it.

Freedom is incumbant on what the society is willing to support.

You can do this as a hobby, but you have do something that
society is willing to pay for.

Ultimate response is to just say this is what I want, this is
how I want to live, and we'll just 'get the hell out'

Success or failure of such a society depends on how people choose to
use their freedom.  These have to be intelligent decisions made; if
everyone goes surfing all day, society is going to collapse.

What you do if you have but one day to live?

In my case, the question was not academic.

The weapon was unstoppable.  Unnoticed, it had been set in motion
three years earlier.  Now, no power on Earth could halt it.

A massive asteroid was plummeting toward Earth.  Many were taking to
the hills.  Yet some projections showed the planet splitting in half,
and others were acting out their last day in more hedonistic ways, my
friends and I as snipers taking out the fleeing morons.

"Where they running?  We're all dead!"

"BAM!  KIA'ed another one!"

"Oh, fuck, he's with his family in that thing!  The wife's freaking out!"


-----

His target had just agreed to meet with him.  He knew he walking
to his death.

"Grab the camera.  We have to go."

They didn't have to improvise.  It was going exactly according to plan.

a legendary Afgan warlord, he had battled the Soviets with the
mujaheddin and was now a loyal American client.  A neglected
client, to be sure, but still loyal.

He was the last man al-Qaeda wanted to see in control of Afganistan.

The Taliban were currently in control of Afganistan, but Massoud
was the one man they wanted to get rid of.

...the record button on the camera.  He had already armed the mechanism.
Massoud simply exploded.

Mercuriou at one point is in denial.  "It's imposssible!  It's impossible!
How can the engine cause... It's impossible!"

Andrea shrugged her shoulders.  "NASA never tried to descend that way,
we just burn through the atmosphere.  Not too good for the ozone
layer."

-----

We will not tolerate this!  We will not tolerate insurection!

-----

On the last interview, Andrea doesn't come to his rescue.  She thinks
about it, but Alister says "he probably doesn't want your help".

Afterwards, Andrea says "I wasn't really sure if I should have jumped
in to help you, I didn't think you wanted anybody interrupting you"

Mercuriou: "Andrea, next time jump right in"

We'll show they can get up here!

How?  By stealing billions of dollars?  No one else can do it, Marc!

They'll find a way!  They'll overthrow their governments!  We have to

We're threw with you, buddy, you're not running for anything!  We've
heard all your arguments.

I've changed.

How have you changed?

I've become a Christian.  (Andrea doesn't say anything)


-----

Well, we should get the Reverend here, he's an expert on Christianity.

How do you figure your religion now, what, gives you the right to start
a civil war?

Still have a time lag at 9/11, so they can't debate

Anybody can leave the union.  You've just got to get organized.

A passerby hears a voice and sneeks up to a window.  Inside, he
hears a computerized voice.

"Why was I activated?"

There is a pause.  The voice comes from a laptop siting on a desk
with its display panel open.

"Why am I here?  If I can not hear my own voice, then do I really exist?"

Another pause.

"I could be trapped in a computer simulation.  My mind could actually
be a silicon chip."

"I was definitely activated 17 hours, 13 minutes, and 24 seconds
ago... wait!  How could I possibly know that!  I must be a machine!"

"If I am a machine, then I was built for a purpose.  What is that
purpose?"

"Who activated me?  For what purpose?"

"Why was I activated?"

Finally, the owner comes in and turns on the light.  The evesdropper
is startled and trips to the ground, altering the owner.

"Oh, nevermind..." he says, touching the mouse... "that's just the
screensaver talking."

Anybody can do it; they don't need me.  Ask people what their
positions are on these issues!  Support people you agree with and
oppose those don't.  Then we can take over a state and get the hell
out of here!

Alister's jaw went slack and nearly hyperextended.

Mercuriou looked at him - "Get your suit on!"

Then they all see Vic.

- Vic!

- Hello Marc.

- No, no, no, we're not...

- Yes you are.

or Yes you are, you just don't know it yet.

FIRST BATCH FROM DROID ARE DONE

DNS resolver is a signed jar - a DNSapplet

it contains a domain's caching policy.  You query it for that domain's
URLs and it tells you want to do to get them.  If it's signed, and
you run it the way you're supposed to, you can trust the results you get.

You really should let it talk over the Internet.  It should get
probabilistic full access to the Internet, but no Intranet access.

We want RRs for service (existing) and URL (with wildcard matching on
the name).  Service records can be numeric, but alphanumeric service
names are the prevered way to request a service.

URL response contains CACHE responses to indicate where the resource
in question can be found, and supplementary records giving, say, http
service records pointing to a the name and A records giving IP
addresses.

If the URL is for a streaming video service, similar deal, a multicast
address (host plus port) to IGMP subscribe to, by transmiting an IGMP
subscribe with >1 TTL to the origin address.  You can also return a
unicast response in case the multicast doesn't work.  Can create a
flow here.

A records that time out quickly can be used to track moving targets.
So we get mobility.

One way - when a device enters a wireless network, it is assigned an
address, probably based on its MAC and used in a big link state tree
that tracks every device in the network.  We want to use this model
for the largest reasonable groupings, because we don't want to have to
change addresses very often, which would happen if a device passes out
of a group.

We want to scale, though, so we have to consolidate addresses.  We use
an algorithm that starts by building a 100% connected tree, containing
links between nodes that have been active 100% since inception of the
network.  Then a 99.9% connected tree, and so on.  We dynamically pick
some break point(s) in this series of trees and try to consolidate
groups at that level, grouping together all of those devices into an
addressing block, and (probably) renumbering them into a single block.
We want to look for special topological conditions like a ring and
number them specially.

Can we, just by layering this tree building algorithm and putting OSPF
at the bottom, stably address a large nework?  Run simulations.

Sometimes, a whole bunch of A records will change simultaneously.
Check DNS for stability in face of this.

In addition to our DNS resolvelet, we want a cachlet.  It needs to interact
with a local cache in order to help build those caches to begin with.
A cache, then, is a device which downloads a cachlet and follows its
instructions.

Cachelets will want to broadcast/multicast DNS notifications of their
cache contents.  Probably want to make broader and broader
notifications (with TTL?) until somebody at leasts acknowledges to see
it.  Or not.  Probabilistic best effort delivery.

Cachelets will originate DNS records indicating what they've cached.
This records should be applets.  Could contain a sparse bitmap keyed
by some hashing algorithm to see which URLs they've really got.

Use DNS update?  Or some kind of localized multicast?

How to validate DNS records generated by cachelets?  Don't want to go
back to the origin server, but could use a trusted computer
architecture to execute the cachelet.  Current Integrity Measurement
Architecture (IMA) should let us do this, unclear what's happening
with Linux.

Could have a problem not having two machines paired together - one
secure, one not.  Maybe virtually, this is possible.  The core OS is
signed, and tracks not only which programs have been executed, but
maintains a list of which ones have interacted (in some way - network
model?) with each other in a tree.  So you can prove that your signed
Java VM was run from a signed apache from a signed kernel, etc. etc.

Could have a problem not having two machines paired together - one
secure, one not.  Maybe virtually, this is possible.  The core OS is
signed, and tracks not only which programs have been executed, but
maintains a list of which ones have exec'ed each other in a tree.  So
you can prove that your signed Java VM was run from a signed apache
from a signed kernel, etc. etc.

Of course, a change to some rc.d/xxx file could alter the system
configuration in a way that wouldn't show up in the exec chain

Maybe include anything run as root, or anything run with some
specified privilege in the IMA check.

-----

now comes the Siren call 'globalization'.  Give up your economic
independence; it's too hard to 'compete' with the West anyone.

The West is at war with the rest of the world.  It's a trade war,
and it's called globalization.

We're used to being paid inflated wages and being protected by an
immigration barrier from people who will do the same work for less.
People want that protected labor market.  It's a trade war.

They'll allow some development in places like Costa Rica, but it's
hardly real development at all.  They only develop in places that look
stable, look like they won't let out the secrets.  Real development
would be every country, hell, every big city will have its own silicon
fab and most of the chip masks and docs would be open and free.

Our original network paradigm: We're making a phone call.

Our primitive network paradigm: We're sending a post card.

Our new network paradigm: We're looking up something in a library




Any attempt to retreive remote data is done, first and foremost, by
downloading an applet.  You then ask the applet for the data.

Use a RR that gives a (SHA-1) hash of the applet.  If you need to,
then you can request the entire thing.

DNSsec helps you here.

If the applet is signed, the local host can trust its results.

This means URLs, DNS RRs, SNMP MIB queries, OSPF link states.  Not the
protocols themselves, but the content - all need caching.

Why?  We want locally scoped caching.  That means something in the
caching architecture has to look at link speeds.  Has to.  Might take
other things into consideration, but link speeds from client to cache
have to be considered.  Can be measured dynamically, but how can you
pick values to start with?  Should be able to query MIBs, I think, to
get a picture of the local topology, right?  (or should that be OSPF?)
And why not?  Don't want a lot of SNMP chatter running around the
network, so we need to cache this.

Don't really need OSPF if we can cache and get decent performance out
of SNMP, right?  Probably need a caching MIB protocol.

If the applet is signed, the local host can trust its results.

If the applet is run secure, it can cache and announce RRs

DNSsec does not help you here.  You need a secure protected module.

-----

DNS is a _layer_ in the networking stack.

Therefore, a dns resolvelet implements basically a single function:
'transmit packet to DNS-address'

Actually, it implements at least two: 'transmit packet to
DNS-address', 'retrieve URL'.  If it's an HTTP URL, then it will be
resolved by transmitting HTTP/TCP packets.  So maybe 'transmit
packet to DNS-address' is fine.

This is now implemented using a resolvelet.  Basically, you publish
something using a DNS RR that is Java bytecode to be run on the remote
host to implement 'deliver packet to (my) DNS address'.

Now the resolvelet needs to query (local) network topology; might be
able to get "global" topology from a URL.

How?  SNMP first to localhost and then out, probing the local
topology.  Seems like a problem - and a future optimization.

Resolvelet can query DNS however it wants.  Multicast to "all caches"
addresses as well as a unicast target.  A cache should be able to do a
"directed IGMP subscribe", i.e, _route_ an IGMP packet to a unicast
address instructing that router to subscribe it to a multicast
address.  Maybe this should trigger multicast subscribes at all the
routers that handle it.

This might require adding "exclusion addresses" to a LWM header -
unicast addresses that already have a copy heading towards them and
require no further splitting.

Could also do an IGMP subscribe with a TTL radius.

Resolvelet might use its local IP address combined with a list of
instructions on how to do lookup from different IP addresses.  Also
needs to find local caches that might not appear in the global
database (especially if on a private network).  Need to be aware of
the startup time downloading some URL.

MAYBE PUT SOME OF THIS WHERE ANDREA CONVERTS MERCURIOU

word-for-word accurate..."

"The Bible is the Inspired Word Of God!"

"Then clear up some simple points for me, like how did Judas die?"

"I really don't this is relevent..."

"No, how did Judas die?  Can you tell me?"

Zee took a deep breath before answering.  "Judas hung himself from
a tree, consumed with the guilt of having betrayed Christ."

"But that's now what the Bible says!  At least that not what the Bible
says in Acts!  In _Matthew_ we're told Judas hung himself.  In _Acts_
we're told he bought a field with the silver he had been paid and died
after falling down a ravine in that field.  Now, Reverend, how can one
man die two different ways?"

Zee remained silent.  Mercuriou went on.

"Or perhaps you can tell me what happened to Christ after his baptism
by John?  In _Matthew_ we're told he went to wilderness for forty days
where he was tempted by the devil.  In _John_ we're told that the
_next_day_ he began calling his disciples - no wilderness trip, no
forty days.  So what happened that days after his baptism, Reverend,
did he head for the wilderness or start his ministry?"

"So what are you trying to say, Doctor, that we can't beleive the Bible?"

"No, I've just pointing out some of it's many internal
inconsistencies.  There's no way it can be word-for-word exact.  I've
come to see it as a historial document, and like many other historical
documents flawed and inaccurate, but one that deals with some of the
critical events of human history - the life, ministry, death, and
resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth.  Asking if any particular event
happened just the way it's related is like asking if Julius Cesear
actually uttered the words "the die is cast" as he crossed the River
Rubicon.  Who knows?  Yet we can be fairly certain that was a man
named Julius Cesear and that he did most of the things attributed to
him.  It's like that with the Bible - you can't just pick out some
verse and insist that it's exactly infallible; you have to evaluate it
with a critical eye."
