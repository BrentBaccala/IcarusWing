Wye: "These people we have in our country who won't obey our laws"

Mercuriou: "Yeah, the majority has all this freedom..."


------

"These people who don't believe in democracy"

(what does BELIEF have to do with it?)

------

Our first indication is when Mercuriou explains it to Alister
  (it's a heist, we're stealing billions of dollars)

------

"See this is what people like you don't understand about capitalism.
It gives people opportunity..."

------

Ecks is going to pull out the line about "work", and Mercuriou's
answer will be "Let's just cut right to the chase and shortcut this debate.
'Work' becomes 'making money'.  There's lots of work you can do..."

-------

The military - they fight to keep the majority in power - the freedom
they fight for is freedom for the majority

-------

It is Andrea that tells Mercuriou that the problem with captialism
is that it is immoral.  That's the essence of its problems.

-------

Liberalism makes people lazy.  Work this in somewhere (probably Ecks)

------

We can't afford to run non-profit restaurants.

Again, let's get clear on our propaganda terms.  Are you staying
that _in_general_ we can't afford this, or that _under_capitalism_
we can't afford this?

I find this very hard to believe.  You want me to believe that we can
pay pitchers and quarterbacks millions of dollars a year, support
video game, music and film industries that each rake in more than ten
billion a year, blow half a trillion a year on the military, but we
can't afford to feed people in restaurants?  Even if this absurd
proposition were true, it would be an argument for rationing, not
capitalism.

------

One can't live without sustaining oneself.

In one sense, this is obviously true - if most of us don't contribute
meaningfully in some way, we'll all starve.

How do you sustain yourself?  By refusing to do for people unless they
pay you?  How does that sustain anyone?  It makes no sense to say that
people aren't sustaining themselves because they are willing to serve
people that others won't.  Let's face it - we live in a society where
we are FORCED to work.  You're not sustaining yourself; you're doing
what you are FORCED to do by an oppressive and immoral society!

Freedom - can you give people the freedom to choose their own work?

-------

Seccession is mostly a symbolic act, but there are some real changes
that we can make with the government.  Abolishing intellectual property
controls.  Ending the drug war.  Opening our immigration policy.

------

This is basically everything that the majority of people oppose!

That's right.  So how do we get our freedom?  Is freedom just for
the majority?

------

Wye: this is one of the most basic, fundamental human rights, that
people have the right to choose their own government!

Mercuriou: It's a bunch of propaganda.

------

Mercuriou: You can define "majority" to be anything you want.

Wye: What whould you like?  Single party rule?

Mercuriou: How about a majority of the people who show up to vote?

Wye: No, no, we don't have those kind... there are voter requirements
that must be met.

Mercuriou: What requirements?  Residency?  So half the people in the world
can't show up, vote, and call the result a legitimate government?

Wye: Exactly!  There are age requirements, residency requirements,
criminal exclusions...

Mercuriou: Why?  Why shouldn't whoever turns up to vote be counted?
We should take you to task.  We should tell everyone who wants to
secede to show up in Honolulu by November 6 and vote!  Turn 'em away
at the polls!  Let's see how many American citizens who show up to
vote won't be counted!

Wye: We're not going to allow some kind of criminal ploy!  We're not
going to let a bunch of hooligans... we've got laws and they must be
followed!

Mercuriou: Senator, your hair is falling off.

Wye: (laughing) I don't know what you mean by that...

Ecks:  Actually, Cathleen, your hair _is_ falling off...

[by this point Wye has dropped the facade and is really answering
questions, at least at first]

Wye: Wh-What!!

A large section of her hair, apparently a wig, had in fact detached
from the top of her head and slid approximately to her left ear!
As she turned her head confusedly and started to grab for her hair,
it detached completely and came off in her hands.

"Oh my God!" she cried as video switched to Ecks.  "I can't
believe... I've never seen that thing before in my life!"

It was near end time anyway, and Ecks used the chance to run a brief
segment profiling _Columbia_'s fairly typical astronaut crew.

-----

"You know what ticks me off?!  That each mission now is just a brief
notice ticked off on TV.  That people think we're ordinary.  That
people think we're just up here because we made the cut in some tough,
tough program.  We're the people who are _really_ moving spaceflight
forward, _Captain_, not you."

-----

The next day, while everyone was still talking about Senator Wye's
"wardrobe malfunction", the _X-Wing_ crew prepared to abandon their
ship forever.

-----

Add to vision quest: Mercuirou needs Vic.

What if Mercuriou needed him?  Needed someone to guide him, to
avoid evil?

Vic groaned aloud.  oh, no, it's too much.  Marc Mercuriou turns
headstrong into a cliche'.  There's just no way to reign him in.  It's
impossible.

_Well_if_you_don't_do_it,_who_will?_

Vic groaned aloud.

-----

Ecks: "I just can't... I can't believe that an American citizen would
push his own country to the brink of civil war.  I can't believe that
a _patriotic_ American would do that.

Mercuriou (laughing): "You're too much!  All your talk about the
heroes who sacrifice their lives for the sake of freedom!  That's what
it comes down to?  We sacrifice when somebody else's neck is in the
block and then play safe when it's our own?"

Ecks: "You don't believe in those heros, _Captain_.  You mock them
with your voice."

Mercuriou: "Believe in them!  I'm one of them!  I'm willing to fight
for my freedom!  I'm just doing it right here in America, that's all!"


-----

"And now the engines are jammed... what?!"

"This was stupid, stupid, the stupidest stupid!" Alister cried.  "No
drooling moron could ever out-stupid our stupid!  We were never going
to colonize Mars!  Why the hell did we do this!?"

"I know, I know!" wailed Mercuriou.  "It's just... I don't know... I
was sure this would work!  I was convinced it would make a difference!
I _knew_; I just absolutely _knew_!"

"This was the most screwball plan ever!  I can't even believe we even
got into orbit without being blown to bits!  NASA has all these
engineers and all; how did we get a bunch of surfers to do it?!"

"It was a miracle," Andrea agreed.

"Look, we need another miracle right now!  We're going to turn into
_Icarus's_Wing_ if we can't fix this!"

"What did you just say?"

"Icarus.  A figure from Greek mythology."

"Yeah, I know who he is.  But what did you just call us?  _Icarus's_Wing_?"

"There you go.  There's your miracle.  You've finally named your ship!"

Mercuriou seethed red.  "That's what you think!  That's your miracle!"

He spun away and propelled for his cabin.

"I'll come up with my own miracle, then!"

Xplorer 1.


------

"It's freedom for the _majority_!  You're shocked that somebody else
would even _aspire_ to freedom!"

-----

------

and all this bullshit about your "competitors"?!  Who are these people
They're your colleagues, right?  They're the people doing the same
kind of things you're doing, but instead of helping each other, you
try to bust each other's bank account.

------

We need to drive these people out of leadership positions!  Let's
see these capitalists run their businesses without employees!

-------

Hawaii will struggle when it's cut off from the mainland.

Yes, but we need to be independent.  Not just politically, but
economically, too.  States and nations need economic independence, or
political independence means little.  I don't believe in
globalization.  We shouldn't be trying to achieve efficiency through
mass economies of scale because then few places actually develop their
own technology.  We need to achieve global economic independence for
all nations, and that means nations producing their own computers,
cars, buildings and factories.  Hawaii will have to achieve that first
for herself, and then lead the rest of world to achieve it for
themselves.

-------

Why someplace nice like Hawaii?  Why not Alaska?

Alaska can secede, too!

------

You think you can treat everyone else like dirt that because there's
100 million of you and you all think the same way, that means everyone
else is supposed to be peaceful and non-violent and sit and take your
shit.

Nobody's every supposed to fight back against the majority, and when
somebody does, you act all shocked and say 'my God, why is this
country so violent?'

------

Is mercuriou willing to accept any democracy?

Willing to accept a limited role

Suspicious of the majority assuming more power

Examples: Estates general, U.S. electroal college has become a
technical excersise in vote counting, Commons is assuming more and
more and more power for itself

He's suspicious of whether the majority will ever accept a limited
role or will they return to their tired old refrain that they are 'the
people' and therefore entitled to rule over everyone else

[readers might not know what I'm refering to]

Ask mercuriou about Checks and balances

compare to a nuclear sub

Any group of people not willing to accept checks on their power by
some other completely separate group, outside of their control, are
tyrants.  It doesn't matter how many of them there are.

-----

Why should Costa Rica have its own silicon fab?  Why not just import
their chips from abroad?  It'll be a lot cheaper that well.

Well, the answer is that Costa Rica needs to build its own silicon
chips unless it wants to be economically and technologically
dependent on other nations.

-----

Get out.  Don't go to Hawaii.  Just get out.

Why should we go overseas?  (for independence)  We're Americans.
We were promissed freedom just like everyone else.

------

A reaction to 9/11 would have been to put bin Laden on trial.
Probably an Islamic tribunal would have been the best bet.  Bush's
"solution" was to invade and conquer two nations and install democracy
at gunpoint.  It was a wildly popular decision that fell into disfavor
only as it became clear that this policy resulted in two civil wars.


--------

I have no interest in working with the capitalists.  I want out of
this country.  I want to live in a society of like-minded people,
people determined to build a gift economy.


-------

Look at a map.  Hawaii should be the dominant central Pacific power.

------

Why don't you go to some other country?

Why don't you just give us a state?

Why should we do that?

You believe in freedom!  You'll just give us one or two states so that
we can live as we please!

That's the majority - you'll fight, fight, fight for everything, and
that's what everyone else has to do to contend with you.

------

I don't want you to have my land.

You want prisions to be built, but you don't want them build next to
you.  But you still manage to get them built.

I would be willing to build a new city.  The existing political system
means that I need my supporters spread out.  I need control of as
many districts as I can get.

------

Zee: There's a supreme court case on secession - Texas vs. fff.

Is our position that Lituania, in fact, needed permission from the
Soviet Union to leave?  Or that the United States is special?  Or that
each nation may set up its internal decrees as it sees fit, and we see
fit to outlaw secession?

Can't we just admit that Lincoln was wrong.  He should have let the
south go.

-----

We're not going to pay you, but we will guarantee you a job!

-----

We don't want you here!  The people of Hawaii don't want you!

What people?

The majority!  The majority!

Well, now we're the majority!  If we can win the election!

Like hell you are!  You're trying to rig the election!  We won't let
you get away with it, we'll fight you, you son-of-a-bitch!

That's the majority - always in charge and ready to fight like hell to
keep it that way!

We won't accept any rigged election!

Do I have 2 percert support?  Do 1 out of 50 Americans support me?
Then why shouldn't we have 1 out of 50 states?  What's rigged about
it?  And so what if we just want to take it and leave - do we have
freedom or don't we?

And what about the people who don't want your socialist shit!

You can go to the mainland!  You can get the hell out!  The New Hawaii
- Love It or Leave It!

What you're talking about is no different from a revolution!  We won't
take it, I swear to God, we won't take it!

That's right!  That's what all the hype about democracy is!  Every 4
years we get to have another revolution!  And somebody else just
figured out how to do it!  And now you don't want the elections
anymore!  Now you don't like democracy!  Now your gonna fight back!

This isn't democracy!  You're taking over the government!

Well, what is democracy, then?  Is it a legal form of government,
where power can be achieved legitimately by anybody who can do it by
following the rules?  Or it a tyranny, just MAJORITY RULE?

Mercuriou hurled the mouse at the LCD screen and the screen shattered.
Alister winced.  They had more screens in storage, but their lives
depended on the equipment, and it wasn't a good sign that the captain
was mad enough to destory things.  (When the US invades Afganistan)

----

Oh, so it's my fault that your launch didn't go as planned.  Is it
also my fault that I was imprisoned in a server room?

----

'You do what you have to do to survive' That's the standard
justification for immorality.

----

It must be packed with obscure references to foreign literature.

-----

"What Ghandi did in India, what Martin Luther King did in the South, what
the velvet revolution was in Eastern Europe..."

(Mercuriou started to talk about Ghandi, and King...)  right before
disaster.

-----

Kyle: No, no, Hawaii is a great place to smuggle.  Everything comes in
by boat.  If you've got money and connections, Hawaii is one of the
easiest states to smuggle into.

-----

Is it worth the price you pay?  Is it worth it to turn your land over
to grow export crops?  Is it worth the lack of independence that you
can't grow your own food?

-----

A Femme Nikita type scene where a group of hackers have tapped into a
phone line.  They get a call, answer it "Authorized Tech Support" (a
recorded voice), some guy is querying about loading a program
attached.  A brief pause, they push a button, another recorded voice -
"Program approved.  Clear for upload."  He clicks off.

She asks her handler - "was that for real?  was that an exercise?"
He's like "what do you care; just do your job."

-----

Andrea dreamt about encouraging people to go to church.

-----

Mercuriou's sham "sugar refinery".

"He's got everything he needs for a launch.  The fuel shipments are
the only thing he can't hide from you!"

-----

Ecks: Hawaiian secession is as crazed as your space launch scheme!
No way it will possibly work!  You'll run out of food!  You think Dole
will just feed you pineapples?  Not to mention energy dependence!
What will your gasoline come from?

Mercuriou: Moving to economic independence will come slowly, but
it has to come.

We're not going to grow nothing but pineapples just to sait the global
demand for the fruit; we will grow our own food.  It

Strike capitalists!  Not just one company or another!  Don't work for
the capitalists!  Refuse to work for these people!  Make sure you work
for people that run charities and co-operatives!  If they are not
willing to abide by the law of charity, then refuse to support them
with your labor!  It's your labor that keeps them in power!

(use the old women and the rich man)

----

end of the foreclosure mess is when we stop enforcing foreclosures.
Or do like ancient Israel and discharge all debts every 50 years.

----

Andrea prophesize 7 years of arid drought for the pineapples

-----

Vic sees in his vision quest that Mercuriou needs him spiritually,
but at his death realizes that he doesn't need him because he's
got Andrea

-----

They'll lock you up for suspicion of being square.

------

Are you going to convert all of Hawaii's food production to local ag?

Not necessarily.

-----

I just can't beleive that you don't want to be President.

I assure you that I have absolutely no desire to be President of the
United States.

------

We used write these things called cheques
Told our money where to go
Now bits and bytes are all the rage
Writing cheques is old and slow.

"Hey there, man, would you get that for us?  be like a brother to me?"

"Just, just give me all the money you've got"

"Yeah, be like a brother then, man."

"Just give me the ATM card, too"

-----

Andrea:  "I should go to the police station.  I've been kidnapped."

She explains everything and all she has is an ID card.  Mercuriou says
he'll take her to the police station.  Burns calls.  They talk.
He hangs up.  He turns around and asks for her ID card.

The amatuer stage actor in Andrea got the best of her.  Whipping out
her ID card, she added with a flourish "National Aeronautics and Space
Administration"

Mercuriou pulls out a .38 special from a holster on his back.

Every though its happening for the second time in two days,
she was taken by surprise.

Andrea is tired, exhausted.  She gives up and goes along with them.

-----

Freedom: I decide that I want to write a book

Objection: Society decides whether it wants to purchase it.

Freedom is incumbant on what the society is willing to support.

You can do this as a hobby, but you have do something that
society is willing to pay for.

Ultimate response is to just say this is what I want, this is
how I want to live, and we'll just 'get the hell out'

Success or failure of such a society depends on how people choose to
use their freedom.  These have to be intelligent decisions made; if
everyone goes surfing all day, society is going to collapse.

The next song started; it was real slow.

"I can't see you anymore!"

Jay-a-a-acob.

"Why? Why, what's wrong?"

"What's wrong?!  You're never here!"

Jay-jay-jay-ja-a-a-cob.
