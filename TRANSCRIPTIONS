Wye: "These people we have in our country who won't obey our laws"

Mercuriou: "Yeah, the majority has all this freedom..."


------

"These people who don't believe in democracy"

(what does BELIEF have to do with it?)

------

Our first indication is when Mercuriou explains it to Alister
  (it's a heist, we're stealing billions of dollars)

------

"See this is what people like you don't understand about capitalism.
It gives people opportunity..."

------

Ecks is going to pull out the line about "work", and Mercuriou's
answer will be "Let's just cut right to the chase and shortcut this debate.
'Work' becomes 'making money'.  There's lots of work you can do..."

-------

The military - they fight to keep the majority in power - the freedom
they fight for is freedom for the majority

-------

It is Andrea that tells Mercuriou that the problem with captialism
is that it is immoral.  That's the essence of its problems.

-------

Liberalism makes people lazy.  Work this in somewhere (probably Ecks)

------

We can't afford to run non-profit restaurants.

Again, let's get clear on our propaganda terms.  Are you staying
that _in_general_ we can't afford this, or that _under_capitalism_
we can't afford this?

I find this very hard to believe.  You want me to believe that we can
pay pitchers and quarterbacks millions of dollars a year, support
video game, music and film industries that each rake in more than ten
billion a year, blow half a trillion a year on the military, but we
can't afford to feed people in restaurants?  Even if this absurd
proposition were true, it would be an argument for rationing, not
capitalism.

------

One can't live without sustaining oneself.

In one sense, this is obviously true - if most of us don't contribute
meaningfully in some way, we'll all starve.

How do you sustain yourself?  By refusing to do for people unless they
pay you?  How does that sustain anyone?  It makes no sense to say that
people aren't sustaining themselves because they are willing to serve
people that others won't.  Let's face it - we live in a society where
we are FORCED to work.  You're not sustaining yourself; you're doing
what you are FORCED to do by an oppressive and immoral society!

Freedom - can you give people the freedom to choose their own work?

-------

Seccession is mostly a symbolic act, but there are some real changes
that we can make with the government.  Abolishing intellectual property
controls.  Ending the drug war.  Opening our immigration policy.

------

This is basically everything that the majority of people oppose!

That's right.  So how do we get our freedom?  Is freedom just for
the majority?

------

Wye: this is one of the most basic, fundamental human rights, that
people have the right to choose their own government!

Mercuriou: It's a bunch of propaganda.

------

Mercuriou: You can define "majority" to be anything you want.

Wye: What whould you like?  Single party rule?

Mercuriou: How about a majority of the people who show up to vote?

Wye: No, no, we don't have those kind... there are voter requirements
that must be met.

Mercuriou: What requirements?  Residency?  So half the people in the world
can't show up, vote, and call the result a legitimate government?

Wye: Exactly!  There are age requirements, residency requirements,
criminal exclusions...

Mercuriou: Why?  Why shouldn't whoever turns up to vote be counted?
We should take you to task.  We should tell everyone who wants to
secede to show up in Honolulu by November 6 and vote!  Turn 'em away
at the polls!  Let's see how many American citizens who show up to
vote won't be counted!

Wye: We're not going to allow some kind of criminal ploy!  We're not
going to let a bunch of hooligans... we've got laws and they must be
followed!

Mercuriou: Senator, your hair is falling off.

Wye: (laughing) I don't know what you mean by that...

Ecks:  Actually, Cathleen, your hair _is_ falling off...

[by this point Wye has dropped the facade and is really answering
questions, at least at first]

Wye: Wh-What!!

A large section of her hair, apparently a wig, had in fact detached
from the top of her head and slid approximately to her left ear!
As she turned her head confusedly and started to grab for her hair,
it detached completely and came off in her hands.

"Oh my God!" she cried as video switched to Ecks.  "I can't
believe... I've never seen that thing before in my life!"

It was near end time anyway, and Ecks used the chance to run a brief
segment profiling _Columbia_'s fairly typical astronaut crew.

-----

"You know what ticks me off?!  That each mission now is just a brief
notice ticked off on TV.  That people think we're ordinary.  That
people think we're just up here because we made the cut in some tough,
tough program.  We're the people who are _really_ moving spaceflight
forward, _Captain_, not you."

-----

The next day, while everyone was still talking about Senator Wye's
"wardrobe malfunction", the _X-Wing_ crew prepared to abandon their
ship forever.

-----

Add to vision quest: Mercuirou needs Vic.

What if Mercuriou needed him?  Needed someone to guide him, to
avoid evil?

Vic groaned aloud.  oh, no, it's too much.  Marc Mercuriou turns
headstrong into a cliche'.  There's just no way to reign him in.  It's
impossible.

_Well_if_you_don't_do_it,_who_will?_

Vic groaned aloud.

-----

Ecks: "I just can't... I can't believe that an American citizen would
push his own country to the brink of civil war.  I can't believe that
a _patriotic_ American would do that.

Mercuriou (laughing): "You're too much!  All your talk about the
heroes who sacrifice their lives for the sake of freedom!  That's what
it comes down to?  We sacrifice when somebody else's neck is in the
block and then play safe when it's our own?"

Ecks: "You don't believe in those heros, _Captain_.  You mock them
with your voice."

Mercuriou: "Believe in them!  I'm one of them!  I'm willing to fight
for my freedom!  I'm just doing it right here in America, that's all!"


-----

"This was stupid, stupid, the stupidest stupid!" Alister cried.  "No
drooling moron could ever out-stupid our stupid!  We were never going
to colonize Mars!"

"I know, I know!" wailed Mercuriou.  "It's just... I don't know... I
was sure this would work!  I was certain it would make a difference!
I _knew_; I just absolutely _knew_!"

"This was the most screwball plan ever!  I can't even believe we even
got into orbit without being blown to bits!  NASA has all these
engineers and all; how did we get a bunch of surfers to do it?!"

"It was a miracle," Andrea agreed.

"Look, we need another miracle right now!  We're going to turn into
_Icarus's_Wing_ if we can't fix this!"

"What did you just say?"

"Icarus.  A figure from Greek mythology."

"Yeah, I know who he is.  But what did you just call us?  _Icarus's_Wing_?"

"There you go.  There's your miracle.  You've finally named your ship!"

Mercuriou seethed red.  "That's what you think!  That's your miracle!"

He spun away and propelled for his cabin.

"I'll come up with my own miracle, then!"

Xplorer 1.


------

"It's freedom for the _majority_!  You're shocked that somebody else
would even _aspire_ to freedom!"

-----

and all this bullshit about your "competitors"?!  Who are these people
They're your colleagues, right?  They're the people doing the same
kind of things you're doing, but instead of helping each other, you
try to bust each other's bank account.
