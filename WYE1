EVERYTHING WRONG WITH DEMOCRACY.  CAPITALISM IS REGULATED.  GOVERNMENT
IS RUN BY ITS PEOPLE.  [MISSING A LOT AT THE END]

Senator Patricia Wye had been a fixture on the Washington scene for
decades, first as a dutiful wife and more recently as a power broker
in her own right.  Seated comfortably by the fireplace in the Senate
Reading Room, her frosted blond coiffure hadn't changed in twenty
years.  She waited until the camera light came on before smiling, to
make it seem more spontaneous.

"Thank you, Rich, it's good to back on your show."

"Senator, what do you say to Captain Mercuriou?"

"Just that this country is run by its people, through their elected
representatives, and the capitalists don't simply 'own' the
government.  If anything, it's the other way around - capitalism is
regulated by the government, though laws."

Mercuriou: Oh, it's regulated, all right.  You've got laws to regulate
factories, you've got laws to regulate fisheries, you've got laws to
regulate farmers.  Has it ever occurred to you that maybe if you chose
decent leaders to begin with, you wouldn't need all of these laws?

Wye: Well, we have to have laws, captain.

Mercuriou: Why?  I'll tell you why.  Because otherwise you'll have two
factory owners trying to 'compete'.  The one will try to run a clean,
safe factory, the other one will just dump his waste into the nearest
river.  The first one will go out of business, and the second one will
be laughing all the way to the bank [CA].
_Ha_ha_ha_,_you_can't_'compete'!_

Wye: And we don't allow that, captain!  We allow free markets and free
enterprise because they are beneficial to society, but we also need
laws to protect the environment and ensure a level playing field, so
that good corporate citizens are not victimized by abusers.

Mercuriou: "Good corporate citizens" - there are none!  A bunch of
'special interests' that lobby to for this restriction or that
exemption and you cook up some convoluted, five hundred page law that
gets another five hundred pages of regulations tacked on by the
bureaucrats - oh, it keeps the lawyers busy!  The little guy [CA] is
buried under paperwork, big business [CA] figures how to make their
millions, and people go around wringing their hands that we've still
got global warming, still can't swim in our rivers, and your answer is
what - pile on more regulations?

Wye: I think those regulations have done a pretty good job!  Would you
have us abandon the Clean Air Act, or the Clear Water Act?  We have
food stamps because we're not willing to let people starve!  We have
social security and Medicare because we're not willing to put the
elderly out on the streets!  Don't go brushing off everything that
this country has accomplished just because you can't see anything but
its faults!

Mercuriou: And who pays for it all?  More taxes?  Or just run it all
up on the national credit card / Or just keep funding the government
like a magician pulling a kerchief out of his fist?

Wye: We have to get deficit spending under control, but we are also
not willing to get rid of these programs because that would cut off
the truly needy.

Mercuriou: You've been saying that for years and the deficits keep
getting bigger.  I've come to the conclusion that you will never be
able to pay off your debts, but that begs the question. [CA] If this
society is so great and so wonderful, why do we need all of these
government programs in the first place?

Wye: Because those government programs have a lot to do with making
our society great!  We allow free enterprise, we allow competition, we
give people the opportunity to earn a reward from their labor, but we
also have programs in place to achieve other goals, such as a clean
environment, a safe food supply, transportation infrastructure, a
minimal social support system.  Women and minorities need protection
against discriminatory labor practices, and our children deserve a
quality education that isn't based on how much money their parents
make.  Those decisions are made through a cooperative political
process.

Mercuriou: That's quite an agenda!  Why do you need to do all that
with the government?  You talk so much about a cooperative government,
but coercion is the very essence of government!  Coercion is what sets
government apart from a business, or a charity, or an individual.
Government is either picking your pocket or twisting your arm, so
essentially you're saying that we need a coercive society to acheive
those goals.  Why is that?

Wye: Well, life is coercive, captain.  You're forced to build shelter
or you'll freeze.  You're forced to plow and harvest or you'll starve.
We have certain social goals that we achieve through tax funding and
government regulation.  We're also careful to check and restrain the
power of government through constitutional law and free elections.

Mercuriou: Why not just put good leaders in positions of authority to
begin with?  Then you wouldn't need the government.

Wye: Well, that's a nice utopia, but we do need the government, just
like we need business and charity.  There's always the criminal
element who thinks that the rules don't apply to them, eh?

Mercuriou: Take the case of my Greek reading aid.  What's your
solution?  Fund free software development with government taxes?

Wye: There are software development efforts funded through government
grant; you could certainly have sought an NSF grant to pursue your
development efforts.

Mercuriou: Aside from all the bureaucracy invoked, the time wasted
writing grant proposals, the documents "included by reference" in a
contract that's already fifty pages long, the usual end-of-year waste
when everybody tries to burn whatever money's left in the budget
because it just evaporates come March 31st, I've got one overriding
question - does any worthwhile project get funded?

Wye: We certainly don't just give out grants for anything.  Grants
are subject to careful review and oversight.

Mercuriou: So what about this much-vaunted freedom to innovate?  The
only funding options you've got are to either become a capitalist, or
convince the government to cut you in on the tax handouts.  To take
another example, you like to talk about heath care reform.  Well,
here's my program for health care reform.  You go to the doctor of
your choice, he provides the care that you need, and if you can't pay
for it, he says "don't worry about it."

Wye: Well, that's just not very realistic, captain.

Mercuriou: Of course it's not realistic!  It's not realistic because
we live under capitalism!  It's not realistic because the doctor can't
eat without money, can't live in a house or rent his office or buy
equipment without money.  We don't need a government health care
system.  We need to create a society where you won't be put out of
business if you won't turn away the poor!

Wye: And how do you propose to do that?

Mercuriou: Get rid of the capitalists!

Wye: How?  Do like the Bolsheviks?  Beat them to death with clubs?
Tie them to stakes and start handing out cigarettes?
Line them up in front of a wall and shoot them? [CA]

Mercuriou: Just stop working for them!  Stop supporting them!
"Just say no" to their nightmare "system"!

Wye: Captain, most people _want_ capitalism!  Progressives have spent
much of the twentieth century convincing voters that some government
controls are needed, but most people want a path to prosperity!

Mercuriou: Well, then maybe your system of government is part of the
problem!  If the majority want a bunch of self-serving creeps to be
their leaders, then maybe we need to get rid of the majority!

Wye: [laughing] So now you're against democracy...

Mercuriou: You're damn right I'm against democracy!

[DO WE WANT SOMETHING IN HERE ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION?  1.6->1.7]

...that cuts everybody off.  We resent throwing money at it,
but we haven't found a better way to deal with it.

Food stamps - we're not going to let people starve
