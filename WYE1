EVERYTHING WRONG WITH DEMOCRACY.  CAPITALISM IS REGULATED.  GOVERNMENT
IS RUN BY ITS PEOPLE.  [MISSING A LOT AT THE END]

Senator Patricia Wye had been a fixture on the Washington scene for
decades, first as a dutiful wife and more recently as a power broker
in her own right.  Seated comfortably by the fireplace in the Senate
Reading Room, she looked around her as the commerical break run.  The
chair was positioned correctly; the coffee cup on the table next to
her was filled to exactly the correct level; an edge of the ornate rug
could be seen on the video monitor.  She waited until the light came on
before smiling, to make it seem more spontaneous.  As she fell easily
into a familiar patter with Ecks, the cameraman noted that her frosted
blond coiffure hadn't changed in twenty years.

"Thank you, Rich, it's good to back on your show."

"Senator, what do you say to Captain Mercuriou?"

Wye: "Nothing more than that this country is run by its people, through
their elected representatives, and the capitalists don't simply 'own'
the government.  If anything, it's the other way around - capitalism
is regulated by the government, though laws."

Mercuriou: "Oh, it's regulated, all right.  You've got laws to
regulate factories, you've got laws to regulate fisheries, you've got
laws to regulate farmers.  Has it ever occurred to you that maybe if
you chose decent leaders to begin with, you wouldn't need all of these
laws?"

Wye: "Well, we have to have laws, Captain."

Mercuriou: "Why?  I'll tell you why.  Because otherwise you'll have two
factory owners trying to 'compete'.  The one will try to run a clean,
safe factory, the other one will just dump his waste into the nearest
river.  The first one will go out of business, and the second one will
retire at forty laughing 'Ha ha ha, You can't _compete_!'

Wye: "And we don't allow that, captain!  We allow free markets and free
enterprise because they are beneficial to society, but we also need
laws to protect the environment and ensure a level playing field, so
that good corporate citizens are not victimized by abusers."

Mercuriou: "'Good corporate citizens' - there are none!  A bunch of
'special interests' that lobby to for this restriction or that
exemption and you cook up some convoluted, five hundred page law that
gets another five hundred pages of regulations tacked on by the
bureaucrats - oh, it keeps the lawyers busy!"

Wye: "I think those regulations have done a pretty good job!  Would you
have us abandon the Clean Air Act, or the Clear Water Act?  We have
food stamps because we're not willing to let people starve!  We have
social security and Medicare because we're not willing to put the
elderly out on the streets!"

Mercuriou: "And who pays for it all?  More taxes?  Or just run it all
up on the national credit card?  How about a magician pulling a
kerchief out of his fist - think he can do it with cash?"

Wye: "We have to get our spending under control, but we are also not
willing to get rid of these programs because that would cut off the
truly needy."

Mercuriou: "Bottom line - if America is so great and so wonderful, why
do we need all of these government programs in the first place?"

Wye: "Because those government programs have a lot to do with making
our society great!  We allow free enterprise, we allow competition, we
give people the opportunity to earn a reward from their labor, but we
also have programs in place to achieve other goals, such as a clean
environment, a safe food supply, transportation infrastructure, a
minimal social support system.  Women and minorities need protection
against discriminatory labor practices, and our children deserve a
quality education that isn't based on how much money their parents
make.  Those decisions are made through a cooperative political
process."

Mercuriou: "That's quite an agenda!  Why do you need to do all that
with the government?  You talk so much about a cooperative government,
but coercion is the very essence of government!  Coercion is what sets
government apart from a business, or a charity, or an individual.
Government is either picking your pocket or twisting your arm, so
you're saying that we need a coercive society to acheive those goals.
Why?"

Wye: "Well, life is coercive, captain.  You're forced to build shelter
or you'll freeze.  You're forced to plow and harvest or you'll starve.
We have certain social goals that we achieve through tax funding and
government regulation.  We're also careful to check and restrain the
power of government through constitutional law and free elections."

Mercuriou: "Why not just put good leaders in positions of authority to
begin with?  Then you wouldn't need the government."

Wye laughed.

Wye: "Well, that'd be Utopia, but unfortunately we do need the
government.  There's always the criminal element who thinks that the
rules don't apply to them, eh, _Captain_?"

Mercuriou: "I've got a better idea - get rid of the capitalists!"

Wye: "How?  Like the Bolsheviks?  Should we use clubs, hypothermia,
or firing squads?"

Mercuriou: "Just stop working for them!  Stop supporting them!
'Just say no' to their nightmare 'system'!"

Wye: "Captain, most people _want_ capitalism!  Progressives have spent
much of the twentieth century convincing voters that some government
controls are needed, but most people want a path to prosperity!"

Mercuriou: "Well, then maybe your system of government is part of the
problem!  If the majority want a bunch of self-serving creeps to be
their leaders, then maybe we need to get rid of the majority!"

Again, Wye laughed.

Wye: "So now you're against democracy..."

Mercuriou: "You're damn right I'm against democracy!"

[DO WE WANT SOMETHING IN HERE ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION?  1.6->1.7]

...that cuts everybody off.  We resent throwing money at it,
but we haven't found a better way to deal with it.

Food stamps - we're not going to let people starve
