% RIGHT TO SECESSION.  CHRISTIANITY TRUMPS DEMOCRACY.

Ecks slumped back in his chair while his producer signaled that Wye
was ready.  Ecks nodded, and switched to [?] her camera without
bothering to introduce her.

Wye: [smile-laughing] "We have a long-standing principle, captain, that
states are not allowed to secede from the Union."

Mercuriou: "Oh, that won't be a problem.  We'll just wave a bunch
of orange flags around in the air.  You'll let us go."

Wye: "This isn't a communist dictatorship, captain.  The people will
see through any gang of criminals no matter what color flags they
wave."

Mercuriou: "What if every pot smoker in this country packs up and moves
to Hawaii?  What would you do then?"

Wye: "We live in a nation of laws.  You are not going to just
make up rules to interpret the election results however you see fit."

Mercuriou: "But these are the laws!  We have free movement between
states, and Hawaii only requires residency for one month before
the election."

Wye: "Our laws were created to implement democracy, and if there are
loopholes, they will be fixed.  We will enforce our laws, captain, we
will enforce our laws.  You're not the only criminal in this country.
Also, I'd like to know what's going to happend once you throw off our
hated government?"

Mercuriou: "It's a symbolic act, showing that minorities can choose
their own leaders and live under a government of their choice."

Wye: "Minorities do have freedom... we have freedoms... minorities
don't need to secede because they have freedom already!"

Mercuriou: "I don't..."

Wye: [angrily] "Except for these people who don't believe in
democracy!"

Mercuriou: "What does belief matter?"

Wye: "You don't believe in democracy!  You don't respect the people!
You support everything that the people oppose!"

Mercuriou: "It's freedom for the _majority_!  You're shocked that
somebody else would even _aspire_ to freedom!"

Wye: "We have freedom!  But we have people in this country, born here,
some of them, who won't obey our laws!"

Mercuriou: "Yeah, the majority has all this freedom..."

Wye: "You reject one of the most basic, most fundamental human rights,
that people have the right to _choose_their_own_government_!"

Mercuriou: "French propaganda!  You can define "majority" to be
anything you want.  What about all the illegal immigrants; can they
vote?  What about the people halfway around the world who desperately
want America to change; can they vote?  What about people like me?  I
don't support this government!  Can I choose my own government?"

Wye: "What whould you prefer?  Single party rule?"

Mercuriou: "How about a majority of the people who show up to vote?"

Wye: "No, no, we don't have those kind... there are voter requirements
that must be met."

Mercuriou: "What requirements?  Residency?  So half the people in the world
can't show up, vote, and call the result a legitimate government?"

Wye: "Exactly!  There are age requirements, residency requirements,
criminal exclusions..."

Mercuriou: "Why?  Why shouldn't whoever turns up to vote be counted?
Everyone who wants to secede show up in Hawaii by November and vote!
Turn 'em away at the polls!  Let's see how many citizens won't be
counted!"



Mercuriou: "Senator, your hair is falling off."

Wye: "I don't know what you're trying to imply..."

Ecks:  "Actually, Patricia, your hair _is_ falling off..."

% by this point Wye has dropped the facade and is really answering
% questions, at least at first

Wye: "Wh-What!!"

A large section of her hair, apparently a wig, had in fact detached
from the top of her head and slid approximately to her left ear!
As she turned her head confusedly and started to grab for her hair,
it detached completely and came off in her hands.

Wye: "Oh my God!" she cried, then started weeping, "I can't
believe..."

The camera switched off, leaving only Ecks and Mercuriou on the
screen.  Ecks recovered first and smoothly segued into a prepared
segment profiling _Columbus_'s fairly typical astronaut crew, seven
spectacular overachievers remarkable only for including the first
Palestinian astronaut, on which half of the piece focused.  When it
ended, Rev. Caiaphas Zee strode confidently into the video Colosseum.
