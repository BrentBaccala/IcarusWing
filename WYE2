% RIGHT TO SECESSION.  CHRISTIANITY TRUMPS DEMOCRACY.

Ecks raged on while his producer signaled furiously from the booth.
Finally, he waved his assent, sank back into his chair and let the
camera switch to Wye without bothering to introduce her.

Wye: "We have a long-standing principle, captain, that states are not
allowed to secede from the Union!"

Mercuriou: "Oh, that won't be a problem!  We'll just wave a bunch
of orange flags around in the air!  You'll let us go!"

Wye: "This isn't a communist dictatorship, captain.  The people will
see through any gang of criminals, no matter what color flags they
wave!"

Mercuriou: "What if every pot smoker in this country packs up and
moves to Hawaii?  And then voted in the next election?  What would you
do then?"

Wye: "We live in a nation of laws.  You are not going to just
make up rules to interpret the election results however you see fit."

Mercuriou: "But these are the laws!  We have free movement between
states, and only one month residency before the election!"

Wye: "Our laws were created to implement democracy, and if there are
loopholes, they will be fixed!"

Mercuriou: "In other words, you'll change the law to make sure you
get the election results that you want!"

Wye: "We will enforce our laws, captain, we will enforce our laws!
You're not the only criminal in this country that can hack some
computer program and find some legal loophole.  Also, I'd like to know
what's going to happen once you throw off our hated government?"

Mercuriou: "It's a symbolic act, showing that minorities can choose
their own leaders and live under a government of their choice."

Wye: "Minorities do have freedom... we have freedoms... minorities
don't need to secede because they have freedom already!"

Mercuriou: "I don't..."

Wye: "We have many laws to ensure freedom for our minorities... except
for these people who don't believe in democracy!  You don't believe in
democracy!  You don't respect the people!  You support everything that
the people oppose!"

Mercuriou: "It's freedom for the _majority_!  You're shocked that
somebody else would even _aspire_ to freedom!"

Wye: "Anyone can aspire... We have freedom!  But these people in this
country, born here, some of them, who won't obey our laws!  You reject
the most fundamental human right, that people can
_choose_their_own_government_!"

Wye: "Now, Captain, let me state this clearly.  The majority rules.
That's it.  You are not going to twist our laws around to make them
mean anything different."

Mercuriou: "I won't accept it!  I'll decide for myself what government
I live under!"

Wye: "I don't... you don't!... You don't believe in democracy!..."

Mercuriou: "Senator, I think your hair is falling off!"

Wye: "What are you trying to imply?!..."

Ecks:  "Actually, Patricia, your hair _is_ falling off..."

% by this point Wye has dropped the facade and is really answering
% questions, at least at first

Wye: "Wh-What!!"

In fact, a large section of her hair had apparently detached from the
top of her head and slid approximately to her left ear!  As she turned
her head confusedly and started to grab her hair, it detached
completely and came off in her hands.

Wye: "I can't..." she cried, then started weeping, "I can't
believe..."

The camera switched off, leaving only Ecks and Mercuriou flabbergasted
on the screen.  Ecks recovered first and smoothly segued into a
prepared segment profiling the Space Shuttle _Columbus_'s fairly
typical astronaut crew, seven spectacular overachievers remarkable
only for including the first Palestinian astronaut, on whom half of
the piece focused.  When it ended, the Reverend Caiaphas Zee strode
confidently into the video Colosseum.
