% RIGHT TO SECESSION.  CHRISTIANITY TRUMPS DEMOCRACY.

Ecks raged on while his producer signaled furiously from the booth.
Finally, he waved his assent, sank back into his chair and let the
camera switch to Wye without bothering to introduce her.

Wye: "We have a long-standing principle, captain, that states are not
allowed to secede from the Union!"

Mercuriou: "Oh, that won't be a problem!  We'll just wave a bunch
of orange flags around in the air!  You'll let us go!"

Wye: "This isn't a communist dictatorship, captain.  The people will
see through any gang of criminals, no matter what color flags they
wave!"

Mercuriou: "What if every pot smoker in this country packs up and moves
to Hawaii?  What would you do then?"

Wye: "We live in a nation of laws.  You are not going to just
make up rules to interpret the election results however you see fit."

Mercuriou: "But these are the laws!  We have free movement between
states, and Hawaii only requires residency for one month before
the election!"

Wye: "Our laws were created to implement democracy, and if there are
loopholes, they will be fixed!"

Mercuriou: "In other words, you'll change the law to make sure you
get the results you want!"

Wye: "We will enforce our laws, captain, we will enforce our laws!
You're not the only criminal in this country.  Also, I'd like to know
what's going to happen once you throw off our hated government?"

Mercuriou: "It's a symbolic act, showing that minorities can choose
their own leaders and live under a government of their choice."

Wye: "Minorities do have freedom... we have freedoms... minorities
don't need to secede because they have freedom already!"

Mercuriou: "I don't..."

Wye: "We have many laws to ensure freedom for our minorities... except
for these people who don't believe in democracy!  You don't believe in
democracy!  You don't respect the people!  You support everything that
the people oppose!"

Mercuriou: "It's freedom for the _majority_!  You're shocked that
somebody else would even _aspire_ to freedom!"

Wye: "Anyone can aspire... We have freedom!  But we have people in
this country, born here, some of them, who won't obey our laws!  You
reject the most fundamental human right, that people can
_choose_their_own_government_!"

Mercuriou: "French propaganda!  You can define 'majority' to be
anything you want.  What about all the illegal immigrants; can they
vote?  What about the people halfway around the world who desperately
want America to change; can they vote?  What about people like me?  I
don't support this government!  Can I choose my own government?"

Wye: "You're not... Captain, let me state this clearly.  The majority
rules.  That's it.  You are not going to twist our laws around to make
them mean anything different."

Mercuriou: "Senator, your idea of reform and mine are two different
things.  You think a revolution means one group of people is in
charge, then we have a revolution, then the same group is still in
charge.  I think a revolution means..."

Wye: "The majority will decide... America will make whatever reforms
her people choose to make!"

Mercuriou: "No, not the people, which invariably
means the majority.  I'll decide for myself what government I live under!"

Wye: "I don't... you don't!... You don't believe in democracy!..."

Mercuriou: "Senator, your hair is falling off!"

Wye: "What are you trying to imply?!..."

Ecks:  "Actually, Patricia, your hair _is_ falling off..."

% by this point Wye has dropped the facade and is really answering
% questions, at least at first

Wye: "Wh-What!!"

A large section of her hair, apparently a wig, had in fact detached
from the top of her head and slid approximately to her left ear!
As she turned her head confusedly and started to grab for her hair,
it detached completely and came off in her hands.

Wye: "Oh my God!" she cried, then started weeping, "I can't
believe..."

The camera switched off, leaving only Ecks and Mercuriou flabbergasted
on the screen.  Ecks recovered first and smoothly segued into a
prepared segment profiling _Columbus_'s fairly typical astronaut crew,
seven spectacular overachievers remarkable only for including the
first Palestinian astronaut, on which half of the piece focused.  When
it ended, the Reverend Caiaphas Zee strode confidently into the video
Colosseum.
