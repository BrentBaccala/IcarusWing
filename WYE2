% RIGHT TO SECESSION.  CHRISTIANITY TRUMPS DEMOCRACY.

Ecks raged on while his producer signaled furiously from the booth.
Finally, he waved his assent, sank back into his chair and let the
camera switch to Wye without bothering to introduce her.

Wye: "We have a long-standing principle, Captain, that states are not
allowed to secede from the Union!"

Mercuriou: "Oh, that won't be a problem!  We'll just wave a bunch
of orange flags around in the air!  You'll let us go!"

Wye: "This isn't a communist dictatorship, Captain.  The people will
see through any gang of criminals, no matter what color flags they
wave!"

Mercuriou: "What if every pot smoker in this country packs up and
moves to Hawaii?  And then voted in the next election?  What would you
do then?"

Wye: "We live in a nation of laws.  You are not going to just
make up rules to interpret the election results however you see fit."

Mercuriou: "But these are the laws!  We have free movement between
states, and only one month residency before the election!"

Wye: "Our laws were created to implement democracy, and if there are
loopholes, they will be fixed!"

Mercuriou: "In other words, you'll change the law to make sure you
get the election results that you want!"

Wye: "We will enforce our laws, Captain, we will enforce our laws!
You're not the only criminal in this country that can hack some
computer program and find some legal loophole.  Also, I'd like to know
what's going to happen once you throw off our hated government?"

Mercuriou: "It shows that minorities can choose their own leaders and
live under a government of their own choice."

Wye: "Minorities do have freedom... we have freedoms... minorities
don't need to secede because they have freedom already!"

Mercuriou: "I don't."

Wye: "Because you don't believe in democracy!  We have many laws to
ensure freedom, but not for criminals who don't respect them!  You
don't believe in democracy!  You don't respect the will of the
people!"

Mercuriou: "It's freedom for the _majority_!  Nobody else should even
_aspire_ to freedom!"

Wye: "You reject the most fundamental human right, that people can
_choose_their_own_leaders_!  Now, Captain, let me state this
clearly.  The majority rules.  That's it.  You are not going to twist
our laws around to make them mean anything different."

Mercuriou: "I won't accept it!  I'll decide for myself what government
I live under!"

Wye: "I don't... you don't!... You don't believe in democracy!..."

Mercuriou: "Senator, your hair is falling off!"

Wye: "What are you trying to imply?!..."

Ecks:  "Actually, Patricia, your hair _is_ falling off..."

% by this point Wye has dropped the facade and is really answering
% questions, at least at first

Wye: "Wh-What!!"

In fact, a large section of her hair had apparently detached from the
top of her head and slid approximately to her left ear!  As she turned
her head confusedly and started to grab her hair, it detached
completely and came off in her hands.

Wye: "I can't..." she cried, "I can't believe..."

The camera switched off, leaving only Ecks and Mercuriou flabbergasted
on the screen.  Ecks recovered first and smoothly segued into a
prepared segment profiling the Space Shuttle _Columbus_'s fairly
typical astronaut crew, seven spectacular overachievers remarkable
only for including the first Palestinian astronaut, on whom half of
the piece focused.  _Columbus_'s final mission objective would be to
rendezvous with _Xplorer_One_, retrieve her crew, and return them to
Earth.  A commercial break followed and when it ended, the Reverend
Caiaphas Zee strode confidently into the video Colosseum.
