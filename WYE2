RIGHT TO SECESSION.  CHRISTIANITY TRUMPS DEMOCRACY.

Wye: [smillaughing] We have a long-standing principle, captain, that
states are not allowed to secede from the Union.

Mercurio: Oh, that won't be a problem.  We'll just wave a bunch
of orange flags around in the air.  You'll let us go.

Wye: (laughing) This isn't a communist dictatorship, captain.  The
people will see through any gang of criminals no matter what color
flags they wave.

Mercurio: What if every pot smoker in this country packs up and moves
to Hawaii?  What would you do then?

Wye: We live in a nation of laws.  You are not going to just
make up rules to interpret the election results however you see fit.

Mercuriou: But these are the laws!  We have free movement between
states, and Hawaii only requires residency for one month before
the election.

Wye: We will enforce our laws, captain, we will enforce our laws.
You're not the only criminal in this country.  Also, I'd like to know
what's going to be so different once you achieve this great goal of
throwing off our hated government.

Mercuriou: It's a symbolic act, showing that minorities can choose
their own leaders and live under a government of their choice.

Wye: Minorities do have freedom... we have freedoms... minorities
don't need to secede because they have freedom already!

Mercuriou: I don't...

Wye: (growing angry) Except for these people who don't believe in
democracy!

[ Mercuriou: What!? (after a pause) What does belief have to do with it?

Wye: You don't believe in democracy!  You don't respect the people!
You support everything that the people oppose!

Mercuriou: It's freedom for the _majority_!  You're shocked that
somebody else would even _aspire_ to freedom!

Wye: We have freedom!  But we have people in this country, born here,
some of them, who won't obey our laws!

Mercuriou: Yeah, the majority has all this freedom...

Wye: You reject one of the most basic, most fundamental human rights,
that people have the right to _choose_their_own_government!

Mercuriou: French propaganda!  [You can define "majority" to be
anything you want.]

Wye: What whould you prefer?  Single party rule?

Mercuriou: How about a majority of the people who show up to vote?

Wye: No, no, we don't have those kind... there are voter requirements
that must be met.

Mercuriou: What requirements?  Residency?  So half the people in the world
can't show up, vote, and call the result a legitimate government?

Wye: Exactly!  There are age requirements, residency requirements,
criminal exclusions...

Mercuriou: Why?  Why shouldn't whoever turns up to vote be counted?
Everyone who wants to secede show up in Hawaii by October 7 and vote!
Turn 'em away at the polls!  Let's see how many citizens won't be
counted!





Mercuriou: Senator, your hair is falling off.

Wye: I don't know what you're trying to imply...

Ecks:  Actually, Patricia, your hair _is_ falling off...

[by this point Wye has dropped the facade and is really answering
questions, at least at first]

Wye: Wh-What!!

A large section of her hair, apparently a wig, had in fact detached
from the top of her head and slid approximately to her left ear!
As she turned her head confusedly and started to grab for her hair,
it detached completely and came off in her hands.

"Oh my God!" she cried, then started weeping, "I can't believe..."

The camera switched off, leaving only Ecks and Mercuriou on the
screen.  Ecks recovered first and smoothly segued into a prepared
segment profiling _Columbia_'s fairly typical astronaut crew,
remarkable only for the first Israeli astronaut, on which half of the
piece focused.  When it ended, Caiaphas Zee strode confidently into
the video Colosseum.

------


That's right?  So how do we get our freedom?

-----

------

You think you can treat everyone else like dirt that because there's
100 million of you and you all think the same way, that means everyone
else is supposed to be peaceful and non-violent and sit and take your
shit.

Nobody's every supposed to fight back against the majority, and when
somebody does, you act all shocked and say 'my God, why is this
country so violent?'

------

Is mercuriou willing to accept any democracy?

Willing to accept a limited role

Suspicious of the majority assuming more power

Examples: Estates general, U.S. electroal college has become a
technical excersise in vote counting, Commons is assuming more and
more and more power for itself

He's suspicious of whether the majority will ever accept a limited
role or will they return to their tired old refrain that they are 'the
people' and therefore entitled to rule over everyone else

[readers might not know what I'm refering to]

Ask mercuriou about Checks and balances

compare to a nuclear sub

Any group of people not willing to accept checks on their power by
some other completely separate group, outside of their control, are
tyrants.  It doesn't matter how many of them there are.


-------

Look at a map.  Hawaii should be the dominant central Pacific power.

------

Why don't you go to some other country?

Why don't you just give us a state?

Why should we do that?

You believe in freedom!  You'll just give us one or two states so that
we can live as we please!

That's the majority - you'll fight, fight, fight for everything, and
that's what everyone else has to do to contend with you.

------

I don't want you to have my land.

You want prisions to be built, but you don't want them build next to
you.  But you still manage to get them built.

I would be willing to build a new city.  The existing political system
means that I need my supporters spread out.  I need control of as
many districts as I can get.

-----

Is it worth the price you pay?  Is it worth it to turn your land over
to grow export crops?  Is it worth the lack of independence that you
can't grow your own food?

------

Maybe America will blithely ignore all comparisons to the Soviet
Union, blow off all domestic idealists as a bunch of weak-willed
liberals, and strong arm Hawaii into submission, but I doubt it.  It's
possible, but I doubt it.  On the other hand, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe
the United States really is another Soviet Union.

-----

The capitalists basic philosophy is that you make people pay, and the
liberals basic philosophy is that you make them obey.  Neither is
comfortable with a leadership model where you ask people for their
support.

-----

Let a restaurant do like Friar Dunstan; let them put an envelope on
the table and ask people put the money in it.  They can't!  They just
can't!  It's anthema to their lifestyle; they can't conceive of a
lifestyle where you ask people.  They only thing they know - they're
just locked in this model - you refuse to do for people unless they
pay you.  You don't ask them.  You tell them.  You pay or the answer
is no.

It's the same thing with the liberals.  Their idea is you have to make
them obey.  There's also the paternalistic aspect.  Many of the
conversatives don't want government regulation of health care, but you
better believe that they want regulation of drugs, abortion,
immigration.

You can't ask people not to have abortions, you can't preach to them,
you have to _make_them_obey_.  It is the dominant model of leadership
in the United States.

-------

-----

Aren't you aware that the majority will decide this election?

I'm most certainly aware of that.  I'm not going to tell them what
they want to hear.  If I lose the election, I don't care.  I won't do
it.  I will not paper over my beliefs and tell them what they want to
hear.

-----

Democracy is in very serious trouble.  Its starting to look like it
will inevitably lead to a society run by the most selfish people you'd
ever want to meet in your life, where everyone is forced to work for
some depraved system.  And the reason is very simple - it's how the
majority of people live.  They're selfish.

The majority are not selfish!  The majority are hard workers!

This is the fraud of capitalism; the idea that you do for yourself and
the invisible hand takes care of everyone else... that actually, the
way to be a good citizen and help society is to be
_in_it_for_yourself_

-----

Even if we would succeed in taking over the whole country, there would
still be so many people so bitterly oppossed to the whole program,
then at least they can leave!  They're not going to like it, but they
can go to the mainland, and their opposition will be far more
embittered and entrenched.  It is best for everyone that those of us
oppossed to the leadership not try to fight for control of the whole
country, but rather take one state and leave.


-----

-----

Democracy is one of two things, and it means different things
to different people.  It's either a particular system
of government or its a philosophical principle that the majority
are entitled to rule over everyone else.

There's no difference.  It's the same thing.

No, it's not the same thing, it's very different.  We can certainly
have a structure/system of government without any conception that it
is somehow entitled to rule more so than any other system of
government.  All systems of government are subject ot the same tests,
and no one of them is special.

What tests?  The will of the people!

No, it is not the will of the people.  First of all, how do you define
'people'?  Invariably, the 'people' means the majority; its a
propaganda term, and, furthermore, its my belief that governments are
justified by the test of First Chronicles, by moral judgements on
their actions, and whether anyone supports them.  You have to look at
their actions to see whether their moral, just, and Godly.  These are
the things that determine whether a government is justified or
legitimate.

-----

So, you think that we should be governed by religious authority!  I
think we abandoned that a few hundred years ago!

----

What majority?  Majority of what?  Majority of whom?  Majority of the
people of the country?  What about a majority of the whole planet?  Or
a majority of an invidual state?  What's special about the country?
Well, basically, we're part of a given majority, the election gives us
the answers we want.  If we talked about a majority of the whole
world, we don't think we'd like that majority; we don't think we'd
like the leadership it'd produce.  We wouldn't feel like we were part
of that majority.  Likewise, a minority could form a majority in one
state.  We want whatever majority puts us in charge.

----

We're calling your bluff.  We're seceding from the union.  I can't win,
but I can cost you everything.  (another Prague Spring)

----

You underestimate... you don't understand the resolve of the
American people!

OK, are you willing to sacrifice everything to keep us as your
vassals?  Give up absolutely everything, any kind of political
credibility you've got left, just show the world an American
Tienanmen Square.  Do you have that kind of resolve?  If so,
I'm going to push it to that point and I'm going to make
sure it costs you everything!

----

You're all gung ho to conquer Afganistan and conquer Iraq, but once a
couple thousand American troops come home in body bags, then you don't
seem to have too much resolve anymore.  The majority always talks a
good game - they're always cracking down, getting tough, having zero
tolerance - they're real pushy, real violent, until somebody stands up
to them, and that's what it takes to make the majority stop and really
think if it's worth it.  Why does this drug war keep going, year after
year?  It's because it doesn't really cost the American public
anything.  If it cost the American public soldiers in body bags, then
it would be wound up.  That's what it takes to make the American
public wonder if this is a good policy.  The majority of American are
very willing to resort to pushy and aggressive tactics, and it has to
really cost them before they're willing to back down.


---

An elected exectuve, and we need to spell out the reasons why.

(in the U.S. case)
The presence of an elected executive might be its fatal flaw.
or it might that democracy is just too unstable to support anything.
But, it's definitely got too much power in the democracy and
not enough effective checks on the majority

Sailboats for petroleum.  Try to cut our use to zero.

Argue about Iraq.

That son-of-a-bitch talks like he's running for President!

He is running for President, Dad... President of Hawaii!

Wye: We're not going to allow some kind of criminal ploy!...  a bunch
of hooligans... we have laws and they will be followed!

-----


How are you going to stop me?

How are you going to stop me?  You gonna to crack down?  You
gonna get tough?

-------


We'll walk into your hail of gunfire.  I see a hundred men marching,
and we'll take it, we'll take it like the Marines on Iwa Jima.  We'll
take your fire, and we'll keep coming.  We'll overrun your position,
and what will you do then?  I see a masacre.  I see a hundred men
marching forwards and only twenty marching on.  I see freedom's (blood
soaked/stained) banner waving in the wind.

Lincoln was the greatest man in American history but the worst president.
Period.  The country can not afford another Lincoln administration.

What if Gorbachev had adopted the precedent of Lincoln?
What if Gorbachev had said that communism isn't the issue, that
the union had to be preserved at all costs and launched Russia
into a civil war in 1991.

What did Lincoln say?  That if he could preserve the union by
freeing all of the slaves, he would, and that if he could preserve
the union by freeing none of the slaves, he would.  What if Gorbachev
had said that if he could preserve the union by abolishing the communist
party he would, that if he could preserve the union by preserving
the communist party he would, but he would preserve the union
at any cost, if necessary through an absolute bloodbath.

Slavery had to be stopped!

What if Eisenhower or Kennedy had say "communism had to be stopped"?
And New York, and Los Angeles, and Washington were also smoldering
radioactive ruins, and there would be people to this day saying that
it was all worth it because communism had to be stopped.

Lincoln made the wrong decision.  He was a bit like George W. Bush.
He made a single bad decision, early on in his presidency, and
it affected everything that came after.

---

Zee: There's a supreme court case on secession - Texas vs. fff.

Is our position that Lituania, in fact, needed permission from the
Soviet Union to leave?  Or that the United States is special?  Or that
each nation may set up its internal decrees as it sees fit, and we see
fit to outlaw secession?

Can't we just admit that Lincoln was wrong.  He should have let the
south go.
